The resulting system enables highfrequency, low-latency ego-motion estimation, along with dense, accurate 3D map registration. Further, the system is capable of handling sensor degradation by automatic reconfiguration bypassing failure modules. Therefore, it can operate in the presence of highly dynamic motion as well as in dark, textureless, and structure-less environments. During experiments, the system demonstrates 0.22\% of relative position drift over 9.3km of navigation and robustness w.r.t aggressive motion such as highway speed driving (up to 33m/s).},

Experimental results on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our model-free approach enables accurate online 3D scene parsing while retaining extensibility to new categories. In addition, we show that unsupervised binary encoding (hashing) techniques can be easily incorporated into our framework for scalability to larger databases.

Visual SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) approaches based solely on geometric methods have proven to be quite capable of accurately tracking the pose of a moving camera and simultaneously building a map of the environment in real-time. However, most of them suffer from the 3D map being too sparse for practical use. The missing points in the generated map correspond mainly to areas lacking texture in the input images, and dense mapping systems often rely on hand-crafted priors like piecewise-planarity or piecewise-smooth depth. These priors do not always provide the required level of scene understanding to accurately fill the map. On the other hand, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have had great success in extracting high-level information from images and regressing pixel-wise surface normals, semantics, and even depth. In this work we leverage this high-level scene context learned by a deep CNN in the form of a surface normal prior. We show, in particular, that using the surface normal prior leads to better reconstructions than the weaker smoothness prior.},

With the trained network we can segment proposed paths and obstacles at run-time using a vehicle equipped with only a monocular camera without relying on explicit modelling of road or lane markings. We evaluate our method on the largescale KITTI and Oxford RobotCar datasets and demonstrate reliable path proposal and obstacle segmentation in a wide variety of environments under a range of lighting, weather and traffic conditions. We illustrate how the method can generalise to multiple path proposals at intersections and outline plans to incorporate the system into a framework for autonomous urban driving.},

Our approach is based on line segments to determine the support points instead of uniformly selecting them over the image range. This way we find very informative support points which preserve the depth discontinuity. The prior of our Bayesian stereo matching method is based on a set of line segments and a set of support points. Both sets are given to a constrained Delaunay triangulation to generate a triangulation mesh which is aware of possible depth discontinuities. We further increased the accuracy by using an adaptive method to sample candidate points along edge segments. We evaluated our algorithm on the Middlebury benchmark.},

However, the reconstructions are noisy and generally incomplete. Moreover, during online reconstruction, the surface changes with every newly integrated depth image which poses a significant challenge for physics engines and path planning algorithms. This paper presents a novel, fast and robust method for obtaining and using information about planar surfaces, such as walls, floors, and ceilings as a stage in 3D reconstruction based on Signed Distance Fields (SDFs). Our algorithm recovers clean and accurate surfaces, reduces the movement of individual mesh vertices caused by noise during online reconstruction and fills in the occluded and unobserved regions. We implemented and evaluated two different strategies to generate plane candidates and two strategies for merging them. Our implementation is optimized to run in real-time on mobile devices such as the Tango tablet. In an extensive set of experiments, we validated that our approach works well in a large number of natural environments despite the presence of significant amount of occlusion, clutter and noise, which occur frequently. We further show that plane fitting enables in many cases a meaningful semantic segmentation of real-world scenes.},

Drawing inspiration from visual state estimation, we employ a direct formulation of the camera measurement model. To this end, we render a view of the target given all calibration parameters, enabling a maximum likelihood estimator formulated on image intensities as measurements. We demonstrate the advantages of avoiding abstraction from image measurements for determining the line delay of a rolling shutter camera and by estimating camera exposure time from motion blur.},

Utilizing the sparse nature of the environment, we propose a ray tracing method with early termination for efficient probabilistic map update. We also propose a divide-and-conquer volume occupancy inquiry method which serves as the core operation for generation of free-space configurations for optimization-based trajectory generation. We experimentally demonstrate that our method maintains the same storage advantage of the original OctoMap, but being computationally more efficient for map update and occupancy inquiry. Finally, by integrating the proposed map structure in a complete navigation pipeline, we show autonomous quadrotor flight through complex environments.},

In order to handle such matters, we propose an adaptive CT method that combines the predicted target position with CT based on Locality Sensitive Histograms (LSH) features. Our method significantly improves CT in four aspects. First, the efficient illumination invariant features extracted based on LSH are used to represent an effective appearance model that is robust to illumination changes. Second, the color attributes tracker is adopted to predict the target position for re-building the new weighted discriminant function which brings in the color information to make up for the inadequacy of Haarlike characteristics. Third, a new model update mechanism is proposed to preserve the stable features while avoid the noisy appearance variations during tracking. Fourth, a trajectory rectification method is employed to refine the tracking location when possible inaccurate tracking occurs. Finally, we show that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance in a comprehensive evaluation over 47 challenging color sequences.},

Automated weed scouting and weed destruction has typically been performed using classification systems able to classify a set group of species known a priori. This greatly limits deployability as classification systems must be retrained for any field with a different set of weed species present within them. In order to overcome this limitation, this paper works towards developing a clustering approach to weed scouting which can be utilized in any field without the need for prior species knowledge. We demonstrate our system using challenging data collected in the field from an agricultural robotics platform. We show that considerable improvements can be made by (i) learning low-dimensional (bottleneck) features using a deep convolutional neural network to represent plants in general and (ii) tying views of the same area (plant) together. Deploying this algorithm on in-field data collected by AgBotII, we are able to successfully cluster cotton plants from grasses without prior knowledge or training for the specific plants in the field.},

Crucially, our method also computes a principled uncertainty associated with each prediction, using a Monte Carlo dropout scheme. We incorporate this uncertainty into a sliding window stereo visual odometry pipeline where accurate uncertainty estimates are critical for optimal data fusion. Our Bayesian sun detection model achieves a median error of approximately 12 degrees on the KITTI odometry benchmark training set, and yields improvements of up to 42\% in translational ARMSE and 32\% in rotational ARMSE compared to standard VO.

We propose UCB style algorithms that are popular in the bandit settings and show how those analyses can be adapted to the online robotic path planning problems. The proposed algorithm trades-off exploration and exploitation in near-optimal manner and has appealing no-regret properties.

However, the localization performance degrades when the observed lighting conditions differ from the conditions when the sparse map was built. We investigate and quantify the effect of lighting variations on visual feature-based localization systems, and discover that maps built in darker conditions can also be effective in bright conditions, but the reverse is not true. We extend Astrobees localization algorithm to make it more robust to changinglight environments on the ISS by automatically recognizing the current illumination level, and selecting an appropriate map and camera exposure time.

Segmenting the 3D point cloud that is provided by modern LiDAR sensors, is the first important step towards the situational assessment pipeline that aims for the safety of the passengers. This step needs to provide accurate segmentation of the ground surface and the obstacles in the vehicles path, and to process each point cloud in real time. The proposed pipeline aims to solve the problem of 3D point cloud segmentation for data received from a LiDAR in a fast and low complexity manner that targets real world applications. The two-step algorithm first extracts the ground surface in an iterative fashion using deterministically assigned seed points, and then clusters the remaining non-ground points taking advantage of the structure of the LiDAR point cloud. Our proposed algorithms outperform similar approaches in running time, while producing similar results and support the validity of this pipeline as a segmentation tool for real world applications.},

To this end, we examine the trade-off between accuracy and speed for different architectures and additionally propose to use an L1 penalty on the filter activations to further encourage sparsity in the intermediate representations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to propose sparse convolutional layers and L1 regularisation for efficient large-scale processing of 3D data. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on the KITTI object detection benchmark and show that Vote3Deep models with as few as three layers outperform the previous state of the art in both laser and laser-vision based approaches by margins of up to 40\% while remaining highly competitive in terms of processing time.},

In contrast, our TSDF-based representation naturally contains this information and thus allows us to more robustly solve the scene differencing problem.

Some prior knowledge is also required to recover an absolute scale for monocular VO. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for monocular VO by using deep Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs). Since it is trained and deployed in an end-to-end manner, it infers poses directly from a sequence of raw RGB images (videos) without adopting any module in the conventional VO pipeline. Based on the RCNNs, it not only automatically learns effective feature representation for the VO problem through Convolutional Neural Networks, but also implicitly models sequential dynamics and relations using deep Recurrent Neural Networks. Extensive experiments on the KITTI VO dataset show competitive performance to state-ofthe-art methods, verifying that the end-to-end Deep Learning technique can be a viable complement to the traditional VO systems.},

First, we propose a linear projection from descriptor space to a lower-dimensional Euclidean space, based on a novel supervised learning strategy employing a triplet loss. Second, we show the importance of including contextual appearance information to the visual feature in order to improve matching under strong viewpoint, illumination and scene changes.

The model could be used for behavior prediction, i.e. whenever a vehicle is detected in a scene, predicting which route it will probably follow and how its trajectory will probably develop over time, which is essential to interpreting the potential risks for longer time horizons. Experiments are conducted using a large set of vehicle trajectories collected from motorways in Beijing, and promising results are presented.},

Our keyframe-based approach applies a fast dense method to estimate odometry, fuses depth measurements from small baseline images, extracts planes from the fused depth map, and optimizes the poses of the keyframes and landmark planes in a global factor graph using incremental smoothing and mapping (iSAM). Using the fast odometry estimation, correct plane correspondences may be found projectively, and the pose of each frame can be estimated accurately even without sufficient planes to fully constrain the 6 degree-of-freedom transformation. The depth map generated from the local fusion process generates higher quality reconstructions and plane segmentations by eliminating noise. Moreover, explicitly modeling plane landmarks in the fully probabilistic global optimization significantly reduces the drift that plagues other dense SLAM algorithms. We test our system on standard RGB-D benchmarks as well as additional indoor environments, demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance as a real-time dense 3D SLAM algorithm, without the use of GPU.},

The objective is to improve the estimation accuracy of an observer by determining the inputs of the system that maximise the amount of information gathered by the outputs over a time horizon. In particular, we use the Observability Gramian (OG) to quantify the richness of the acquired information. First, we define a trajectory for the flat outputs of the system by using B-Spline curves. Then, we exploit an online gradient descent strategy to move the control points of the B-Spline in order to actively maximise the smallest eigenvalue of the OG over the whole planning horizon. While the system travels along its planned (optimized) trajectory, an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to estimate the system state. In order to keep memory of the past acquired sensory data for online re-planning, the OG is also computed on the past estimated state trajectories. This is then used for an online replanning of the optimal trajectory during the robot motion which is continuously refined by exploiting the state estimation obtained by the EKF. In order to show the effectiveness of our method we consider a simple but significant case of a planar robot with a single range measurement. The simulation results show that, along the optimal path, the EKF converges faster and provides a more accurate estimate than along other possible (non-optimal) paths.},

Data augmentation techniques are shown to yield significant performance gains, resulting in a greater than two-fold reduction in the number of training images required. In contrast, transferring knowledge between orchards contributed to negligible performance gain over initialising the Deep Convolutional Neural Network directly from ImageNet features. Finally, to operate over orchard data containing between 100-1000 fruit per image, a tiling approach is introduced for the Faster R-CNN framework. The study has resulted in the best yet detection performance for these orchards relative to previous works, with an F1-score of > 0.9 achieved for apples and mangoes.},

Thanks to colorization techniques, these methods exploit the filters learned from 2D images to extract meaningful representations in 2.5D. Still, the perceptual signature of these two kind of images is very different, with the first usually strongly characterized by textures, and the second mostly by silhouettes of objects. Ideally, one would like to have two CNNs, one for RGB and one for depth, each trained on a suitable data collection, able to capture the perceptual properties of each channel for the task at hand. This has not been possible so far, due to the lack of a suitable depth database. This paper addresses this issue, proposing to opt for synthetically generated images rather than collecting by hand a 2.5D large scale database. While being clearly a proxy for real data, synthetic images allow to trade quality for quantity, making it possible to generate a virtually infinite amount of data. We show that the filters learned from such data collection, using the very same architecture typically used on visual data, learns very different filters, resulting in depth features (a) able to better characterize the different facets of depth images, and (b) complementary with respect to those derived from CNNs pretrained on 2D datasets. Experiments on two publicly available databases show the power of our approach.},

Some approaches also exploit sequential information to alleviate the problem of spatially inconsistent and non-perfect image matches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning a discriminative holistic image representation which exploits the image content to create a dense and salient scene description. These salient descriptions are learnt over a variety of datasets under large perceptual changes. Such an approach enables us to precisely segment the regions of an image which are geometrically stable over large time lags. We combine features from these salient regions and an off-the-shelf holistic representation to form a more robust scene descriptor. We also introduce a semantically labeled dataset which captures extreme perceptual and structural scene dynamics over the course of 3 years. We evaluated our approach with extensive experiments on data collected over several kilometers in Freiburg and show that our learnt image representation outperforms off-the-shelf features from the deep networks and hand-crafted features.},

We encode this knowledge in shape priors, which are learnt over a small keypoint-annotated dataset. We then formulate a shapeaware adjustment problem that uses the learnt shape priors to recover the 3D pose and shape of a query object from an image. For shape representation and inference, we leverage recent successes of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the task of object and keypoint localization, and train a novel cascaded fully-convolutional architecture to localize vehicle keypoints in images. The shape-aware adjustment then robustly recovers shape (3D locations of the detected keypoints) while simultaneously filling in occluded keypoints. To tackle estimation errors incurred due to erroneously detected keypoints, we use an Iteratively Re-weighted Least Squares (IRLS) scheme for robust optimization, and as a by-product characterize noise models for each predicted keypoint. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving benchmarks, and present superior results to existing monocular, as well as stereo approaches.},

  abstract      = {Environmental conditions and external effects, such as shocks, have a significant impact on the calibration parameters of visual-inertial sensor systems. Thus longterm operation of these systems cannot fully rely on factory calibration. Since the observability of certain parameters is highly dependent on the motion of the device, using short data segments at device initialization may yield poor results. When such systems are additionally subject to energy constraints, it is also infeasible to use full-batch approaches on a big dataset and careful selection of the data is of high importance. In this paper, we present a novel approach for resource efficient self-calibration of visual-inertial sensor systems. This is achieved by casting the calibration as a segment-based optimization problem that can be run on a small subset of informative segments. Consequently, the computational burden is limited as only a predefined number of segments is used. We also propose an efficient information-theoretic selection to identify such informative motion segments. In evaluations on a challenging dataset, we show our approach to significantly outperform state-of-the-art in terms of computational burden while maintaining a comparable accuracy.},

  abstract      = {Dense depth map estimation from stereo cameras has many applications in robotic vision, e.g., obstacle detection, especially when performed in real-time. The range in which depth values can be accurately estimated is usually limited for two-camera stereo setups due to the fixed baseline between the cameras. In addition, two-camera setups suffer from wrong depth estimates caused by local minima in the matching cost functions. Both problems can be alleviated by adding more cameras as this creates multiple baselines of different lengths and since multi-image matching leads to unique minima. However, using more cameras usually comes at an increase in run-time. In this paper, we present a novel embedded system for multibaseline stereo. By exploiting the parallelization capabilities within FPGAs, we are able to estimate a depth map from multiple cameras in real-time. We show that our approach requires only little more power and weight compared to a twocamera stereo system. At the same time, we show that our system produces significantly better depth maps and is able to handle occlusion of some cameras, resulting in the redundancy typically desired for autonomous vehicles. Our system is small in size and leight-weight and can be employed even on a MAV platform with very strict power, weight, and size requirements.},

The objectives of this sensor fusion are twofold; first to mitigate the inherent drift of the attitude estimates of the visual odometry, and second, to estimate the orientation directly with respect to the North-East-Down frame. A key contribution of the paper is to present a rigorous stability analysis showing that the attitude estimates of the observer converge exponentially to the true attitude and to provide a lower bound for the convergence rate of the observer. Through experimental studies, we demonstrate that the observer effectively compensates for the inherent drift of the pure monocular vision based attitude estimation and is able to recover the North-East-Down orientation even if it is initialized with a very large attitude error.},

Segments provide a good compromise between local and global descriptions, incorporating their strengths while reducing their individual drawbacks. SegMatch does not rely on assumptions of perfect segmentation, or on the existence of objects in the environment, which allows for reliable execution on large scale, unstructured environments. We quantitatively demonstrate that SegMatch can achieve accurate localization at a frequency of 1Hz on the largest sequence of the KITTI odometry dataset. We furthermore show how this algorithm can reliably detect and close loops in real-time, during online operation. In addition, the source code for the SegMatch algorithm is made publicly available.},

This paper proposes a robust probabilistic model for projection errors, based on real world data. For that, we argue that projection distances follow Gamma distributions, and hence, the introduction of these models in a probabilistic formulation of the motion estimation process increases both precision and accuracy.

Thus, the generated map data requires automated evaluation procedures that do not require experienced personnel or ground truth knowledge of the underlying environment. A particularly important question enabling commercial applications is whether a given map is of sufficient quality for localization. This paper proposes a framework for predicting localization performance in the context of visual landmark-based mapping. Specifically, we propose an algorithm for predicting performance of vision-based localization systems from different poses within the map. To achieve this, a metric is defined that assigns a score to a given query pose based on the underlying map structure. The algorithm is evaluated on two challenging datasets involving indoor data generated using a handheld device and outdoor data from an autonomous fixedwing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Using these, we are able to show that the score provided by our method is highly correlated to the true localization performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the predicted map quality can be used within a belief based path planning framework in order to provide reliable trajectories through high-quality areas of the map.},

Unlike in some of the recent approaches where the number of components in a GMM belief can only be reduced, in our approach this can also go up such as due to perceptual aliasing present in the environment. Furthermore, our approach naturally integrates with inference, providing a unified framework for robust passive and active perception.

The use of Echo State Networks allows to deal with temporal dependencies implicitly, while the spatial mapping with a Gaussian Process estimator exploits the fact that Echo State Networks learn linear combinations of complex temporal dynamics. The resulting Echo State Map elegantly combines spatial and temporal cues into a single representation. We showcase the method in the exposure modeling task of building dust distribution maps for foundries, a challenge which is of great interest to occupational health researchers. Results from simulated data and real world experiments highlight the potential of Echo State Maps.

Urban driving environments are frequently subject to large dynamic outliers, such as buses, trucks etc. These objects can mask the static elements of the prior map that we rely on for localisation. At the same time some objects change shape in a way that is less dramatic but equally pernicious during localisation for example trees over seasons and in wind, shop fronts and doorways. In this paper, we show how we can learn in high resolution, the areas of our map that are subject to such distractions (low value data) in a place-dependent approach. We demonstrate how to utilise this model to select individual laser measurements for localisation. Specifically, by leveraging repeated operation over weeks and months, for each point in our map pointcloud we build distributions of the errors associated with that point for multiple localisation passes. These distributions are then used to determine the legitimacy of laser measurements prior to their use in localisation. We demonstrate distraction suppression as a front-end process to large scale localiser by incrementally adding 50km of error data to our base map and show that robustness is improved over the base system with a further 10km of urban driving.},

Added routes can be followed autonomously using visual localization. To enable long-term operation that is robust to appearance change, its Multi-Experience Localization (MEL) leverages many previously driven experiences when localizing to the manually taught network. While this multi-experience method is effective across appearance change, the computation becomes intractable as the number of experiences grows into the tens and hundreds. This paper introduces an algorithm that prioritizes experiences most relevant to live operation, limiting the number of experiences required for localization. The proposed algorithm uses a visual Bag-of-Words description of the live view to select relevant experiences based on what the vehicle is seeing right now, without having to factor in all possible environmental influences on scene appearance. This system runs in the loop, in real time, does not require bootstrapping, can be applied to any pointfeature MEL paradigm, and eliminates the need for visual training using an online, local visual vocabulary. By picking a subset of visually similar experiences to the live view, we demonstrate safe, vision-in-the-loop route following over a 31 hour period, despite appearance as different as night and day.},

Monocular SLAM systems, in contrast, can exploit wide-angle cameras and do not have the depth range limitation, but are unstable for textureless scenes. We present a SLAM system that uses both an RGBD camera and a wide-angle monocular camera for combining the advantages of the two sensors. Our system extracts 3D point features from RGBD frames and 2D point features from monocular frames, which are used to perform both RGBD-to-RGBD and RGBDto-monocular registration. To compensate for different FOV and resolution of the cameras, we generate multiple virtual images for each wide-angle monocular image and use the feature descriptors computed on the virtual images to perform the RGBD-to-monocular matches. To compute the poses of the frames, we construct a graph where nodes represent RGBD and monocular frames and edges denote the pairwise registration results between the nodes. We compute the global poses of the nodes by first finding the minimum spanning trees (MSTs) of the graph and then pruning edges that have inconsistent poses due to possible mismatches using the MST result. We finally run bundle adjustment on the graph using all the consistent edges. Experimental results show that our system registers a larger number of frames than using only an RGBD camera, leading to larger-scale 3D reconstruction.},

Specifically, we build upon ORBSLAM, presumably the current state-of-the-art solution both in terms of accuracy as efficiency, and extend its formulation to simultaneously handle both point and line correspondences. We propose a solution that can even work when most of the points are vanished out from the input images, and, interestingly it can be initialized from solely the detection of line correspondences in three consecutive frames. We thoroughly evaluate our approach and the new initialization strategy on the TUM RGB-D benchmark and demonstrate that the use of lines does not only improve the performance of the original ORB-SLAM solution in poorly textured frames, but also systematically improves it in sequence frames combining points and lines, without compromising the efficiency.},

The main focus of this work is to analyze the cross-modality influence between depth and semantic prediction maps on their joint refinement. While most of the previous works solely focus on measuring improvements in accuracy, we propose a way to quantify the cross-modality influence. We show that there is a relationship between final accuracy and cross-modality influence, although not a simple linear one. Hence a larger cross-modality influence does not necessarily translate into an improved accuracy. We find that a beneficial balance between the cross-modality influences can be achieved by network architecture and conjecture that this relationship can be utilized to understand different network design choices. Towards this end we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture that fuses the state-of-the-art results for depth estimation and semantic labeling. By balancing the crossmodality influences between depth and semantic prediction, we achieve improved results for both tasks using the NYU-Depth v2 benchmark.},

In this work, we develop a SLAM framework that uses relative featureto-feature measurements to exploit this structural property of SLAM. Relative feature measurements are used to pose a linear estimation problem for pose-to-pose orientation constraints. This is followed by solving an iterative non-linear on-manifold optimization problem to compute the maximum likelihood estimate for robot orientation given relative rotation constraints. Once the robot orientation is computed, we solve a linear problem for robot position and map estimation. Our approach reduces the computational complexity of non-linear optimization by posing a smaller optimization problem as compared to standard graph-based methods for feature-based SLAM. Further, empirical results show our method avoids catastrophic failures that arise in existing methods due to using odometery as an initial guess for non-linear optimization, while its accuracy degrades gracefully as sensor noise is increased. We demonstrate our method through extensive simulations and comparisons with an existing state-of-the-art solver. Keywords: SLAM, graph-based SLAM, non-linear optimization, relative measurements},

  abstract      = {Current state-of-the-art vehicle safety systems, such as assistive braking or automatic lane following, are still only able to help in relatively simple driving situations. We introduce a Parallel Autonomy shared-control framework that produces safe trajectories based on human inputs even in much more complex driving scenarios, such as those commonly encountered in an urban setting. We minimize the deviation from the human inputs while ensuring safety via a set of collision avoidance constraints. We develop a receding horizon planner formulated as a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) including analytic descriptions of road boundaries, and the configurations and future uncertainties of other traffic participants, and directly supplying them to the optimizer without linearization. The NMPC operates over both steering and acceleration simultaneously. Furthermore, the proposed receding horizon planner also applies to fully autonomous vehicles. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in a wide variety of complex driving scenarios such as leftturns across traffic, passing on busy streets, and under dynamic constraints in sharp turns on a race track.},

  abstract      = {This work addresses the task of camera localization in a known 3D scene given a single input RGB image. State-of-the-art approaches accomplish this in two steps: firstly, regressing for every pixel in the image its 3D scene coordinate and subsequently, using these coordinates to estimate the final 6D camera pose via RANSAC. To solve the first step, Random Forests (RFs) are typically used. On the other hand, Neural Networks (NNs) reign in many dense regression tasks, but are not test-time efficient. We ask the question: which of the two is best for camera localization? To address this, we make two method contributions: (1) a test-time efficient NN architecture which we term a ForestNet that is derived and initialized from a RF, and (2) a new fully-differentiable robust averaging technique for regression ensembles which can be trained endto-end with a NN. Our experimental findings show that for scene coordinate regression, traditional NN architectures are superior to test-time efficient RFs and ForestNets, however, this does not translate to final 6D camera pose accuracy where RFs and ForestNets perform slightly better. To summarize, our best method, a ForestNet with a robust average, which has an equivalent fast and lightweight RF, improves over the stateof-the-art for camera localization on the 7-Scenes dataset [1]. While this work focuses on scene coordinate regression for camera localization, our innovations may also be applied to other continuous regression tasks.},

Such changes are especially likely to occur for loop closures in SLAM. Alternatives exist which attempt to match images more robustly. In our paper, we perform a systematic evaluation of real-time capable methods. We determine their accuracy and robustness in the context of odometry and of loop closures, both on real images as well as synthetic datasets with simulated lighting changes. We find that for real images, a Census-based method outperforms the others. We make our new datasets available online3 .},

In this paper we show that we can augment an omnidirectional SLAM pipeline with straightforward dense stereo estimation and simple and robust room model fitting to obtain rapid and reliable estimation of the global shape of typical rooms from short robot motions. We have tested our method extensively in real homes, offices and on synthetic data.

Representing the dynamic scene as a set of rigid clusters drastically accelerates the motion estimation, while segmenting it into static and dynamic parts allows us to separate the camera motion (odometry) from the rest of motions observed in the scene. The resulting method robustly and accurately determines the motion of an RGB-D camera in dynamic environments with an average runtime of 80 milliseconds on a multi-core CPU.

However, SeqSLAM relies heavily on exhaustive sequence matching, a computationally expensive process that prevents the algorithm from being used in dealing with large maps. In this paper, we propose Fast-SeqSLAM, an efficient version of SeqSLAM. Fast-SeqSLAM has a much reduced time complexity without degrading the accuracy, and this is achieved by using an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithm to match the current image with those in the robot map and extending the idea of SeqSLAM to greedily search a sequence of images that best match with the current sequence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fast-SeqSLAM algorithm in appearance based loop closure detection.},

Moreover, the classic measure for the certainty of the depth estimate fails as well: The matching score between the template and any pixel on the epipolar line is perfect. This results for common scenes in incorrect matches with very high confidence, some even resistant to leftright image checks. It is straightforward to try to address this by adding a second stereo head in a perpendicular direction. However, it is nontrivial to identify the failure and fuse the two depth maps in a real-time system. A simple weighted average will alleviate the problem but still result in a very large error in the depth map. Our contributions are: 1) We derive a model to predict the failure of stereo by leveraging the matching scores and 2) we propose a combined cost function to fuse two depth maps from orthogonal stereo heads using the failure prediction, matching score and consistency. We show the resulting system in real-time operation on a low-latency system in indoor, urban and natural environments.},

We first estimate the pairwise camera parameters by optimally matching single-view pedestrian tracks using social awareness. Then, we show the impact of jointly estimating the network parameters. This is done by formulating a nonlinear least square optimization problem, leveraging a continuous approximation of the matching function.

These ambitions are hindered by the submodularity property of mutual information, which makes optimal solutions NP-hard to compute.

Maps composed of atoms can distinguish between free, occupied, and unknown space, support computationally efficient insertions and collision queries, provide free space planning guarantees, and achieve state-of-the-art memory efficiency over large volumes. This is achieved while simultaneously reducing quantization effects in the vicinity of surfaces and defining a useful implicit surface representation.},

Our routine requires three simple datasets which are easily acquired using most modern multispectral cameras. We evaluate the framework with a cost-effective snapshot multispectral camera.

However, vision systems are known to be imperfect and prone to failure due to variable lighting, terrain changes, and other environmental variables. We describe a system for learning simple failure recovery maneuvers based on experience. This involves both recognizing when the vision system is prone to failure, and associating failures with appropriate responses that will most likely help the robot recover. We implement this system on an autonomous quadrotor and demonstrate that behaviors learned with our system are effective in recovering from situational perception failure, thereby improving reliability in cluttered and uncertain environments.},

This paper addresses these issues by formulating Bayesian Optimisation for continuous trajectories within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework.

Furthermore, loop closure recognition based on low-level features is often viewpoint-dependent and subject to failure in ambiguous or repetitive environments. On the other hand, object recognition methods can infer landmark classes and scales, resulting in a small set of easily recognizable landmarks, ideal for view-independent unambiguous loop closure. In a map with several objects of the same class, however, a crucial data association problem exists. While data association and recognition are discrete problems usually solved using discrete inference, classical SLAM is a continuous optimization over metric information. In this paper, we formulate an optimization problem over sensor states and semantic landmark positions that integrates metric information, semantic information, and data associations, and decompose it into two interconnected problems: an estimation of discrete data association and landmark class probabilities, and a continuous optimization over the metric states. The estimated landmark and robot poses affect the association and class distributions, which in turn affect the robot-landmark pose optimization. The performance of our algorithm is demonstrated on indoor and outdoor datasets.},

For the next level of robot intelligence and intuitive user interaction, maps need to extend beyond geometry and appearance they need to contain semantics. We address this challenge by combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a state-of-the-art dense Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) system, ElasticFusion, which provides long-term dense correspondences between frames of indoor RGB-D video even during loopy scanning trajectories. These correspondences allow the CNNs semantic predictions from multiple view points to be probabilistically fused into a map. This not only produces a useful semantic 3D map, but we also show on the NYUv2 dataset that fusing multiple predictions leads to an improvement even in the 2D semantic labelling over baseline single frame predictions. We also show that for a smaller reconstruction dataset with larger variation in prediction viewpoint, the improvement over single frame segmentation increases. Our system is efficient enough to allow real-time interactive use at frame-rates of 25Hz.},

This paper considers the problem of augmenting a traditional CNN for handling image-like input (called main-channel input) with additional, highly predictive, non-image-like input (called side-channel input). An example of such a task would be to predict whether a robot path is collision-free given an occupancy grid of the environment and the paths start and goal configurations; the occupancy grid is the main-channel and the start and goal are the side-channel. This paper presents several candidate network architectures for doing so. Empirical tests on robot collision prediction and control problems compare the the proposed architectures in terms of learning speed, memory usage, learning capacity, and susceptibility to overfitting.},

In recent years, Lagrangian duality has proved suitable to provide good, frequently tight relaxations of the hard PGO problem through convex Semidefinite Programming (SDP). In this work, we build from the state-ofthe-art Lagrangian relaxation [1] and contribute a complete recovery procedure that, given the (tractable) optimal solution of the relaxation, provides either the optimal MLE solution if the relaxation is tight, or a remarkably good feasible guess if the relaxation is non-tight, which occurs in specially challenging PGO problems (very noisy observations, low graph connectivity, etc.). In the latter case, when used for initialization of local iterative methods, our approach outperforms other state-ofthe-art approaches converging to better solutions. We support our claims with extensive experiments.},

Conventional automated driving strategies make automated vehicles foolish in dilemmas such as making lane-changes in heavy traffic, handling a yellow traffic light, and crossing a double-yellow line to pass an illegally parked car. In this paper, we introduce a novel automated driving strategy that allows automated vehicles to tackle these dilemmas. The key insight behind our automated driving strategy is that expert drivers understand human interactions on the road and comply with mutually-accepted rules, which are learned from countless experiences. In order to teach the driving strategy of expert drivers to automated vehicles, we propose a general learning framework based on maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning and Gaussian process. Experiments are conducted on a 5.2 km-long campus road at Seoul National University and demonstrate that our framework performs comparably to expert drivers in planning trajectories to handle various dilemmas.},

The first viewpoint configuration of this branch is selected, but the path towards it is decided through a second planning step. Within that, a new tree is sampled, admissible branches arriving at the reference viewpoint are found and the robot belief about its state and the tracked landmarks of the environment is propagated. The branch that minimizes the expected localization and mapping uncertainty is selected, the corresponding path is executed by the robot and the whole process is iteratively repeated.

It can be formalized as that of finding budgeted routes in a graph such that the reward collected by the route is maximized, where the reward at nodes can be dependent. Unfortunately, the problem is NP-Hard and the state of the art methods are too slow to even present an approximate solution online. Here we present Randomized Anytime Orienteering (RAOr) algorithm that provides near optimal solutions while demonstrably converging to an efficient solution in runtimes that allows the solver to be run online. The key idea of our approach is to pose orienteering as a combination of a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and a Traveling Salesman Problem. This formulation allows us to restrict the search space to routes that incur minimum distance to visit a set of selected nodes, and rapidly search this space using random sampling. The paper provides the analysis of asymptotic nearoptimality, convergence rates for RAOr algorithms, and present strategies to improve anytime performance of the algorithm. Our experimental results suggest an improvement by an order of magnitude over the state of the art methods in relevant simulation and in real world scenarios.},

EPC leverages an affine dynamics model that is updated online via Locally Weighted Projection Regression (LWPR) to capture nonlinearities, uncertainty, and changes in the system dynamics. This model enables the NMPC problem to be re-cast as a quadratic program (QP). The QP can then be solved via multi-parametric techniques to generate a mapping from state, reference, and dynamics model to a locally optimal, affine feedback control law. These mappings, in conjunction with the basis functions learned via LWPR, define a notion of experience for the controller as they capture the full inputoutput relationship for previous actions the controller has taken. The resulting experience database allows EPC to avoid solving redundant optimization problems, and as it is constructed online, enables the system to operate more efficiently over time. We demonstrate the performance of EPC through a set of hardware-in-the-loop simulation studies of a quadrotor micro air vehicle that is subjected to unmodeled exogenous perturbations.},

The formulation of the photometric residual explicitly accounts for the camera response function and lens vignetting (which can be calibrated in advance), as well as unknown illumination gains and biases, which are estimated on a per-feature or per-image basis. We present a detailed evaluation of our algorithm on 50 datasets with high-precision ground truth, which amount to approximately 1.5 hours of localization data. Through a direct comparison with a pointfeature based method, we demonstrate that the use of photometric residuals results in increased pose estimation accuracy, with approximately 23\% lower estimation errors, on average.},

In turn, this approach is scalable and enables a multitude of capabilities such as experience-based learning and long-term autonomy. Using multi-modal simultaneous localization and mapping and a few example use-cases, we demonstrate the versatility and extensible nature that centralized persistence and SLAMinDB can provide.

A strategy that uses the depth information for scale estimation and background elimination is proposed to select the neighbourhood around the keypoints in order to build precise invariant descriptors. Proposed descriptor relies on the ordering of both grayscale intensity and shape information in the neighbourhood. Comprehensive experiments which confirm the effectiveness of the proposed RGB-D feature when compared with CSHOT [1] and LOIND[2] are presented.

The apparent naive solution of simply undistorting the images using pre-calibrated parameters does not apply to this case since rows in the undistorted image are no longer captured at the same time. To address this we develop an algorithm that incorporates radial distortion into an existing state-of-theart direct semi-dense SLAM system that takes rolling-shutters into account. We propose a method for finding the generalized epipolar curve for each rolling-shutter radially distorted image. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and compare it favorably with the state-of-the-art in direct semidense rolling-shutter SLAM.},

By doing so, the C-SKF has memory requirements typically linear in the size of the map, as opposed to quadratic for storing the maps covariance. Moreover, and in order to bound the processing needs of the C-SKF (between linear and quadratic in the size of the map), we introduce two relaxations of the CSKF algorithm: (i) The sC-SKF, which operates on the Cholesky factors of independent sub-maps resulting from dividing the map into overlapping segments. (ii) We formulate an efficient method for sparsifying the Cholesky factor by selecting and processing a subset of loop-closure measurements based on their temporal distribution. Lastly, we assess the processing and memory requirements of the proposed algorithms, and compare their positioning accuracy against other inconsistent mapbased localization approaches that employ measurement-noisecovariance inflation to compensate for the maps uncertainty.},

In contrast, we enable the robot to maintain 3D models for each of the segmented objects and to improve them over time through fusion. As a result, our system can enable a robot to maintain a scene description at the object level which has the potential to allow interactions with its working environment; even in the case of dynamic scenes.},

Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-N ETS predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-N ETS enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-N ETS also work well on real data.},

Our algorithm initially determines a next-best-view (NBV) that maximizes information gain and plans a collision-free path to reach the NBV. Along the path, the MAV explores the greatest unknown area although it sometimes misses minor unreconstructed region, such as a hole or a sparse surface. To cover such a region, we propose an online inspection algorithm that consistently provides an optimal coverage path toward the NBV in real time. The algorithm iteratively refines an inspection path according to the acquired information until the modeling of a specific local area is complete. We evaluated the proposed algorithm by comparing it with other state-of-the-art approaches through simulated experiments. The results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches in both exploration and 3D modeling scenarios.},

In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.},

We develop expected kernel and expected sub-map notions to deal with uncertain inputs. In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robots perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem. According to our experimental results, although taking into account pose uncertainty leads, as expected, to more uncertain maps, by modeling the nonlinearities present in the observation space WGPs can improve the map quality.},

The processing is speeded up by efficiently implemented approximate nearest neighbour fields under the Euclidean distance criterion, which permits the use of compact Gauss-Newton updates in the optimization. The registration is formulated as a maximum a posterior problem to deal with outliers and sensor noise, and the equivalent weighted least squares problem is consequently solved by iteratively reweighted least squares method. A variety of robust weight functions are tested and the optimum is determined based on the probabilistic characteristics of the sensor model. Extensive evaluation on publicly available RGB-D datasets shows that the proposed method predominantly outperforms existing state-ofthe-art methods.},

In this work we present a novel tightly-coupled Visual-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping system that is able to close loops and reuse its map to achieve zero-drift localization in already mapped areas. While our approach can be applied to any camera configuration, we address here the most general problem of a monocular camera, with its well-known scale ambiguity. We also propose a novel IMU initialization method, which computes the scale, the gravity direction, the velocity, and gyroscope and accelerometer biases, in a few seconds with high accuracy. We test our system in the 11 sequences of a recent micro-aerial vehicle public dataset achieving a typical scale factor error of 1\% and centimeter precision. We compare to the state-of-the-art in visual-inertial odometry in sequences with revisiting, proving the better accuracy of our method due to map reuse and no drift accumulation.

Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated and evaluated using qualitative and quantitative results (the Area-Under-the-Curve (AUC) of the detection precision-recall curve). We are able to achieve an AUC of 0.71 for peduncle detection on field-grown sweet peppers.

A probabilistic, volumetric method for determining the optimal next best view is developed based on a partial model of a 3D object of unknown shape and size.

Whereas these additional degrees of freedom increase flexibility, they introduce a more challenging planning problem. The approach proposed in this paper is built upon a search-based planner. We describe how to flexibly integrate joint angle changes in the path planning process and furthermore propose a representation of the robot configuration that substantially reduces the computational burden. In addition, we introduce search guidance heuristics that are particularly useful in environments in which a robot is required to pass over obstacles, such as on agricultural fields.

A blob detector based on a fully convolutional network extracts candidate regions in the images. A counting algorithm based on a second convolutional network then estimates the number of fruit in each region. Finally, a linear regression model maps that fruit count estimate to a final fruit count. We analyze the performance of the pipeline on two distinct data sets of oranges in daylight, and green apples at night, utilizing human generated labels as ground truth. We also show that the pipeline has a short training time and performs well with a limited data set size.

Consistent with the state of the art, the map is encoded as a graph of poses, and to cope with very large mapping capabilities, loop closures are asserted by comparing the features extracted from a query laser scan against a previously acquired corpus of scan features using a bag-of-words (BoW) scheme. Two contributions are here presented. First, to benefit from the graph topology, feature frequency scores in the BoW are computed not only for each individual scan but also from neighboring scans in the SLAM graph. This has the effect of enforcing neighbor relational information during document matching. Secondly, a weak geometric check that takes into account feature ordering and occlusions is introduced that substantially improves loop closure detection performance. The two contributions are evaluated both separately and jointly on four common SLAM datasets, and are shown to improve the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of precision and recall in most of the cases. Moreover, our current implementation is designed to work at nearly frame rate, allowing loop closure query resolution at nearly 22 Hz for the best case scenario and 2 Hz for the worst case scenario.},

Correspondence estimation has long been the domain of hand-engineered features, but more recently deep learning techniques have provided powerful tools for learning features from raw data. The drawback of the latter approach is that a vast amount of (labelled, typically) training data is required for learning. This paper advocates a new approach to learning visual descriptors for dense correspondence estimation in which we harness the power of a strong 3D generative model to automatically label correspondences in RGB-D video data. A fully-convolutional network is trained using a contrastive loss to produce viewpoint- and lighting-invariant descriptors. As a proof of concept, we collected two datasets: the first depicts the upper torso and head of the same person in widely varied settings, and the second depicts an office as seen on multiple days with objects re-arranged within. Our datasets focus on re-visitation of the same objects and environments, and we show that by training the CNN only from local tracking data, our learned visual descriptor generalizes towards identifying non-labelled correspondences across videos. We furthermore show that our approach to descriptor learning can be used to achieve state-of-the-art single-frame localization results on the MSR 7-scenes dataset without using any labels identifying correspondences between separate videos of the same scenes at training time.},

Third, K lightweight models are combined as a mixture model to further enhance the performance of the lightweight models. Applied to the challenging task of weed segmentation, we improve accuracy from 85.9\%, using a traditional approach, to 93.9\% by adapting a complicated pre-trained DCNN with 25M parameters (Inception-v3). The downside to this adapted model, Adapted-IV3, is that it can only process 0.12fps. To make this approach fast while still retaining accuracy, we learn lightweight DCNNs which when combined can achieve accuracy greater than 90\% while using considerably fewer parameters capable of processing between 1.07 and 1.83 frames per second, up to an order of magnitude faster and up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

Using the sensory output of multiple robots and fusing it in an efficient way enables the creation of globally accurate and consistent metric maps. To combine data from multiple agents into a global map, most existing approaches use a central entity that collects and manages the information from all agents. Often, the raw sensor data of one robot needs to be made available to processing algorithms on other agents due to the lack of computational resources on that robot. Unfortunately, network latency and low bandwidth in the field limit the generality of such an approach and make multi-robot map building a tedious task. In this paper, we present a distributed and decentralized back-end for concurrent and consistent robotic mapping. We propose a set of novel approaches that reduce the bandwidth usage and increase the effectiveness of inter-robot communication for distributed mapping. Instead of locking access to the map during operations, we define a version control system which allows concurrent and consistent access to the map data. Updates to the map are then shared asynchronously with agents which previously registered notifications. A technique for data lookup is provided by state-of-the-art algorithms from distributed computing. We validate our approach on real-world datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

This paper presents and evaluates an algorithm that alternates between online place recognition and offline map maintenance with the goal of producing the best performance with a fixed map size. At the core of the algorithm is the concept of a Summary Map, a reduced map representation that includes only the landmarks that are deemed most useful for place recognition. To assign landmarks to the map, we use a scoring function that ranks the utility of each landmark and a sampling policy that selects the landmarks for each place. The Summary Map can then be used by any descriptor-based inference method for constant-complexity online place recognition. We evaluate a number of scoring functions and sampling policies and show that it is possible to build and maintain maps of a constant size and that place-recognition performance improves over multiple visits.},

The proposed approach does not require a prior vocabulary learning phase and relies purely on the appearance of the scene for loop closure detection without the need of odometry or GPS estimates. The vocabulary generation process is based on feature tracking between consecutive images to incorporate pose invariance. In addition, this process is coupled with a simple likelihood function to generate the most suitable loop closure candidate and a temporal consistency constraint to filter out inconsistent loop closures. Evaluation on different publicly available outdoor urban and indoor datasets shows that the presented approach is capable of generating higher recall at 100\% precision in comparison to the state of the art.},

The method shows improvements in performance over the state of the art, particularly in robustness to aggressive motion and temporary lack of visual features. The proposed on-line method starts with visual odometry to estimate the ego-motion and to register point clouds from a scanning lidar at a high frequency but low fidelity. Then, scan matching based lidar odometry refines the motion estimation and point cloud registration simultaneously. We show results with datasets collected in our own experiments as well as using the KITTI odometry benchmark. Our proposed method is ranked #1 on the benchmark in terms of average translation and rotation errors, with a 0.75\% of relative position drift. In addition to comparison of the motion estimation accuracy, we evaluate robustness of the method when the sensor suite moves at a high speed and is subject to significant ambient lighting changes.},

In this paper we propose an experience-based approach to matching a local 3D swathe built using a push-broom 2D LIDAR to a number of prior 3D maps, each of which has been collected during normal driving in different conditions. Local swathes are converted to a combined 2D height and reflectance representation, and we exploit the GPU rendering pipeline to densely sample the localisation cost function to provide robustness and a wide basin of convergence. Prior maps are incrementally built into an experience-based framework from multiple traversals of the same environment, capturing changes in environment structure and appearance over time. The LIDAR localisation solutions from each prior map are fused with vehicle odometry in a probabilistic framework to provide a single pose solution suitable for automated driving. Using this framework we demonstrate realtime centimetre-level localisation using LIDAR data collected in a dynamic city environment over a period of a year.},

We first present a system for generating and texturing the prior using a LIDAR scanner and camera. We then describe how we can localise against that prior with a single camera, using an information-theoretic measure of image similarity. This process requires dealing with the distortions induced by a wide-angle camera. We present and justify an interesting approach to this issue in which we distort the prior map into the image rather than vice-versa. Finally we explain how the general purpose computation functionality of a modern GPU is particularly apt for our task, allowing us to run the system in real time.

This paper presents a lightingresistant VT&R system that uses experimentally trained colorconstant images to autonomously navigate difficult outdoor terrain despite changes in lighting. We show through an extensive field trial that our algorithm is capable of autonomously following a 1km outdoor route spanning sandy/rocky terrain, grassland, and wooded areas. Using a single visual map created at midday, the route was autonomously repeated 26 times over a period of four days, from sunrise to sunset with an autonomy rate (by distance) of over 99.9\%.

We provide a technique to verify if a given 2D SLAM solution is globally optimal. The insight is that, while computing the optimal solution is hard in general, duality theory provides tools to compute tight bounds on the optimal cost, via convex programming. These bounds can be used to evaluate the quality of a SLAM solution, hence providing a sanity check for stateof-the-art incremental and batch solvers. Experimental results show that our technique successfully identifies wrong estimates (i.e., local minima) in large-scale SLAM scenarios. This work, together with [1], represents a step towards the objective of having SLAM techniques with guaranteed performance, that can be used in safety-critical applications.},

The choice of M-estimator and the manual tuning of these parameters is always a source of uncertainty when applying the technique to new data or a new problem. In this paper we develop the concept of self-tuning Mestimators. We first make the connection between many common M-estimators and elliptical probability distributions. This connection shows that the choice of M-estimator is an assumption that the residuals belong to a well-defined elliptical distribution. We exploit this implication in two ways. First, we develop an algorithm for tuning the M-estimator parameters during iterative optimization. Second, we show how to choose the correct M-estimator for your data by examining the likelihood of the data given the model. We fully derive these algorithms and show their behavior on a representative example of visual simultaneous localization and mapping.},

As structural information is typically ignored, such methods suffer from perceptual aliasing and reduced recall, due to the ambiguity of observations. In a bid to boost the robustness of appearance-based place recognition, we consider the world as a continuous constellation of visual words, while keeping track of their covisibility in a graph structure. Locations are queried based on their appearance, and modelled by their corresponding cluster of landmarks from the global covisibility graph, which retains important relational information about landmarks. Complexity is reduced by comparing locations by their graphs of visual words in a simplified manner. Test results show increased recall performance and robustness to noisy observations, compared to state-of-the-art methods.},

From this partially and only positive labeled training data, our approach infers a model for the traversability analysis, thereby requiring very little manual effort for the human.

Building upon our previous work in Experience-based Navigation [1], we continually grow and curate a visual map of the world that explicitly supports multiple representations of the same place. We refer to these representations as experiences, where a single experience captures the appearance of an environment under certain conditions. Pedagogically, an experience can be thought of as a visual memory. By accumulating experiences we are able to handle cyclic appearance change (diurnal lighting, seasonal changes, and extreme weather conditions) and also adapt to slow structural change. This strategy, although elegant and effective, poses a new challenge: In a region with many stored representations which one(s) should we try to localise against given finite computational resources? By learning from our previous use of the experience-map, we can make predictions about which memories we should consider next, conditioned on how the robot is currently localised in the experience-map. During localisation, we prioritise the loading of past experiences in order to minimise the expected computation required. We do this in a probabilistic way and show that this memory policy significantly improves localisation efficiency, enabling long-term autonomy on robots with limited computational resources. We demonstrate and evaluate our system over three challenging datasets, totalling 206km of outdoor travel. We demonstrate the system in a diverse range of lighting and weather conditions, scene clutter, camera occlusions, and permanent structural change in the environment.},

A standard posegraph SLAM system adds a new entry for every new pose into the location database, which grows linearly and unbounded in time and thus becomes unsustainable. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a new map-reduction approach that pre-constructs a fixed-size place-recognition database amenable to the limited storage and processing resources of the vehicle by exploiting the high-level structure of the environment as well as the vehicle motion. In particular, we introduce the concept of location utility which encapsulates the visitation probability of a location and its spatial distribution relative to nearby locations in the database as a measure of the value of potential loop-closure events to occur at that location. While finding the optimal reduced location database is NPhard, we develop an efficient greedy algorithm to sort all the locations in a map based on their relative utility without access to sensor measurements or the vehicle trajectory. This enables pre-determination of a generic, limited-size place-recognition database containing the N best locations in the environment. To validate the proposed approach, we develop an open-source street-map simulator using real city-map data and show that an accurate map (pose-graph) can be attained even when using a place-recognition database with only 1\% of the entries of the corresponding full database.},

Selecting actions that decrease the map uncertainty while not significantly increasing the robots localization uncertainty is challenging. We present a novel information-theoretic utility function that uses both Shannons and Renyis definitions of entropy to jointly consider the uncertainty of the robot and the map. This allows us to fuse both uncertainties without the use of manual tuning. We present simulations and experiments comparing the proposed utility function to state-of-the-art utility functions, which only use Shannons entropy.

A defining aspect of night-time urban scenes is the presence and effect of artificial lighting be that in the form of street or interior lighting through windows. By building a model of the environment which includes a representation of the spatial location of every light source, localisation becomes possible using monocular cameras. One of the challenges we face is the gross change in light appearance as a function of distance due to flare, saturation and bleeding city lights certainly do not appear as point features. To overcome this, we model the appearance of each light as a function of vehicle location, using this to inform our data-association decisions and to regularise the cost function which is used to infer vehicle pose. In this way we develop a place-dependent but stable sensor model which is customised for the particular environment in which we are operating. We demonstrate that our system is able to localise successfully at night over 12 km in situations where a traditional point feature based system fails.},

For that reason, we accumulate shape information over time and register it in a common reference frame. Matching the resulting shapes requires a strategy for dealing with partial observations. We therefore investigate several distance functions and kernels that implement different such strategies and compare their matching performance in quantitative experiments.

The approach is especially suited for large configuration spaces that include many invariant constraints, such as those found with whole body humanoid motion planning. Experiences are generated using probabilistic sampling and stored in a sparse roadmap spanner (SPARS), which provides asymptotically near-optimal coverage of the configuration space, making storing, retrieving, and repairing past experiences very efficient with respect to memory and time. The Thunder framework improves upon past experience-based planners by storing experiences in a graph rather than in individual paths, eliminating redundant information, providing more opportunities for path reuse, and providing a theoretical limit to the size of the experience graph. These properties also lead to improved handling of dynamically changing environments, reasoning about optimal paths, and reducing query resolution time. The approach is demonstrated on a 30 degrees of freedom humanoid robot and compared with the Lightning framework, an experience-based planner that uses individual paths to store past experiences. In environments with variable obstacles and stability constraints, experiments show that Thunder is on average an order of magnitude faster than Lightning and planning from scratch. Thunder also uses 98.8\% less memory to store its experiences after 10,000 trials when compared to Lightning. Our framework is implemented and freely available in the Open Motion Planning Library.},

This often overlooked secondorder information provides vital context when it comes to map use and planning. Our motivation here is to improve the performance of the popular Teach and Repeat paradigm [1] which has been shown to enable truly large-scale field operation. When using the taught route for localisation, it is often assumed the robot is following exactly, or is sufficiently close to, the original path, enabling successful localisation. However, what happens if it is not possible, or not desirable to exactly follow the mapped path? How far off the beaten track can the robot travel before it gets lost? We present an approach for assessing this localisation area around a taught route, which we refer to as the localisation envelope. Using a combination of physical sampling and a Gaussian Process model, we are able to accurately predict the localisation performance at unseen points.},

Instead, we propose a novel approach that fuses 3D geometric data with appearance-based segmentation of 2D information in an automatic system. Our contribution is twofold: first, we propagate labels from frame to frame using depth priors of the segmented road avoiding user interaction most of the time; second, we transfer the segmented road labels to 3D laser point clouds. This reduces the complexity of stateof-the-art segmentation algorithms running on 3D Lidar data. Segmentation fails is in only 3\% of the cases over a sequence of 13,600 monocular images spanning an urban trajectory of more than 10km.},

We improve on current methods in two ways: first, we maintain a richer (higher-dimensional) representation of the terrain that is better able to distinguish between different training examples. Second, we use a Gaussian-process classifier for terrain assessment due to its superior introspective abilities (leading to better uncertainty estimates) when compared to other classifier methods in the literature.

Current state of the art techniques have been shown to work in real time with an admirable performance in desktop-size environments. Unfortunately, as we show in this paper, when applied to larger indoor environments, performance often degrades. A common cause is the presence of large affine texture-less areas like by walls, floors, ceilings and drab objects such as chairs and tables. These produce noisy and worse still, grossly erroneous initial seeds for the depthmap that greatly impede successful optimisation. We solve this problem via the introduction of a new nonlocal higher-order regularisation term that enforces piecewise affine constraints between image pixels that are far apart in the image. This property leverages the observation that the depth at the edges of bland regions are often well estimated whereas their inner pixels are deeply problematic. A welcome by-product of our proposed technique is an estimate of the surface normals at each pixel. We will show that in terms of implementation, our algorithm is a natural extension of the often used variational approaches. We evaluate the proposed technique using real datasets for which we have ground truth models.},

In fact, the selection of norm is pivotal with respect to the intrinsic surface characteristics. Our goal is to show how dense interpolation of sparse range data can be leveraged of more exotic and non-convex regularisers such as the log and logTGV [1] which can better capture the scene geometry. In contrast to state of the art solutions, we do not restrict ourselves to this set of norms, instead we search for the most apt norm for each semantically segmented part of the scene. Our energy model selection use Bayesian optimisation to learn the best choice of free parameters. This results in an adaptive model selection and the generalisation of well studied regularisation norms. We conclude with a detailed experimental analysis of our approach using a basis of four norms over a set of challenging outdoor scenes.},

Previous work in the literature has typically approached the problem using adhoc solutions that do not consider the possible future states of other agents, and thus have difficulty scaling to complex traffic scenarios where the actions of participating agents are tightly conditioned on one another. In this paper we present multipolicy decision-making (MPDM), a decision-making algorithm that exploits knowledge from the autonomous driving domain to make decisions online for an autonomous vehicle navigating in traffic. By assuming the controlled vehicle and other traffic participants execute a policy from a set of plausible closedloop policies at every timestep, the algorithm selects the best available policy for the controlled vehicle to execute. We perform policy election using forward simulation of both the controlled vehicle and other agents, efficiently sampling from the high-likelihood outcomes of their interactions. We then score the resulting outcomes using a user-defined cost function to accommodate different driving preferences, and select the policy with the highest score. We demonstrate the algorithm on a realworld autonomous vehicle performing passing maneuvers and in a simulated merging scenario.},

To tackle this problem, we propose a two-step procedure. First, we check if the current map is consistent using a statistical test. If the map is consistent, we navigate the robot back to its starting location using a standard navigation system. In case of an inconsistent map, however, we propose to rewind the trajectory from the current location to the start without relying on a map. We implemented the proposed system in ROS and showcase its effectiveness on an autonomous exploration robot in real underground and office environments.},

Since the problems are inevitably solved in uncontrived environments where sensors cannot function with their highest quality, it is important for the estimation methods to be robust to degeneracy. This paper proposes an online method to mitigate for degeneracy in optimizationbased problems, through analysis of geometric structure of the problem constraints. The method determines and separates degenerate directions in the state space, and only partially solves the problem in well-conditioned directions. We demonstrate utility of this method with data from a camera and lidar sensor pack to estimate 6-DOF ego-motion. Experimental results show that the system is able to improve estimation in environmentally degenerate cases, resulting in enhanced robustness for online positioning and mapping.},

To that end, in this paper we propose a novel feature-based model of environmental evolution over time. Our approach is based upon the development of an expressive probabilistic generative feature persistence model that describes the survival of abstract semi-static environmental features over time. We show that this model admits a recursive Bayesian estimator, the persistence filter, that provides an exact online method for computing, at each moment in time, an explicit Bayesian belief over the persistence of each feature in the environment. By incorporating this feature persistence estimation into current state-of-the-art graphical mapping techniques, we obtain a flexible, computationally efficient, and information-theoretically rigorous framework for lifelong environmental modeling in an ever-changing world.},

Depth information is obtained both from static stereo relating the fixed-baseline images of the stereo camera and temporal stereo relating images from the same camera, taken at different points in time. We show that our method outperforms not only vision-only or loosely coupled approaches, but also can achieve more accurate results than state-of-the-art keypoint-based methods on different datasets, including rapid motion and significant illumination changes.

However, current methods for recognizing object instances require that, during training, many pictures are taken of each object from a large number of viewing angles. This procedure is slow and requires much manual effort before the robot can begin to operate in a new environment. We have developed a novel procedure for training a neural network to recognize a set of objects from just a single training image per object. To obtain robustness to changes in viewpoint, we take advantage of a supplementary dataset in which we observe a separate (non-overlapping) set of objects from multiple viewpoints. After pre-training the network in a novel multi-stage fashion, the network can robustly recognize new object instances given just a single training image of each object. If more images of each object are available, the performance improves. We perform a thorough analysis comparing our novel training procedure to traditional neural network pre-training techniques as well as previous stateof-the-art approaches including keypoint-matching, templatematching, and sparse coding, and we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms these previous approaches. Our method can thus be used to easily teach a robot to recognize a novel set of object instances from unknown viewpoints.},

The computational savings enabled by this approach allow for significantly increased reconstruction density and quality when compared to the state-ofthe-art.

For each keyframe, a grid of image faces is created by optimized intersection of the segment projection lines. These faces define a segment adjacency graph, wherein we perform our Breadth-First Plane Search (BFPS). The found plane hypotheses are merged maximally with respect to a structure-preserving criterion by growing coplanar regions across the graph. Hypotheses violating the visibility constraint are discarded based on fast per-face and mostly nongeometrical evaluation of the scene and image graph. Finally, each image face gets back-projected onto an optimal plane to obtain a 3D surface model. The presented system is a complete and automatic solution suitable for mapping an environment in real-time scenarios like robotic exploration. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on several indoor scenes of varying complexity. Compared to a pure 3D analysis of segments, we see a speed-up by one to almost two orders of magnitude, while still improving on reconstruction accuracy.},

  abstract      = {We present a method for compressing trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Given a set of trajectories sampled from a space we construct a basis for compression whose elements correspond to paths in the space which are topologically distinct. This is achieved by computing a canonical representative for each element in a generating set for the first homology group and decomposing these representatives into a set of distinct paths. Trajectory compression is subsequently accomplished through representation in terms of this basis. Robustness with respect to outliers is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist in the super-level sets of the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) above a threshold. Robustness with respect to small scale topological artifacts is achieved by only considering those elements of the first homology group which exist for a sufficient range in the super-level sets. We demonstrate this approach to trajectory compression in the context of a large set of crowd-sourced GPS trajectories captured in the city of Chicago. On this set, the compression method achieves a mean geometrical accuracy of 108 meters with a compression ratio of over 12.},

Our combined method leverages these synergies to improve the performance of perception. We analyze the proposed method in average cases and difficult scenarios using a variety of rigid and articulated objects. The results show that our integrated solution achieves better results than solutions for the individual problems.

We show that standard online learning methods based on decision trees perform comparably bad for such data streams, which are however particularly relevant for mobile robots that need to learn semantics persistently. To address this, we use Mondrian forests (MF), a recent online learning algorithm that is independent on the data order. We present an extension of that algorithm and show that MF are less overconfident than standard Random Forests. In experiments on the KITTI benchmark, we show that this leads to a substantially improved classification performance for data streams, rendering our approach very attractive for lifelong robot learning applications.

The 3D point cloud data of this frame was classified after actively learning semantics from a stream of 10 000 previous samples. The bottom left image shows the result from actively learning an online Random Forest classifier, the right one shows the result using a modified Mondrian forest instead. A green bounding box refers to a correct classification, while red boxes are wrong predictions. As we show in this paper, the better performance of Mondrian forests comes from their higher capability to learn from streams of data.},

Most commonly a rich set of images covering a static scene are used to jointly estimate the pose of the cameras and the observed 3D-structure. For many practical application however the assumption of static scenes and sufficient coverage by images does not hold. In fact for industrial inspection the change in the scene is of most interest and the limited resources on mobile platforms dont allow for extensive data captures. In this paper we investigate the potential of combining multiple independent captures of a place to selectively reconstruct a scene over time. We propose an incremental reconstruction algorithm which identifies and fuses novel data into a joint model of the scene. Being able to identify changing parts of the scene is particularly interesting for mobile applications where bandwidth, storage and processing power are limited. Through detailed experiments, we show the potential of our approach to use multiple mobile devices to reconstruct and update a model of the static part of the environment over time.},

The best performing solutions, however, have utilized visual information by either matching entire images or parts thereof. Most commonly, vision based approaches are inspired by information retrieval and utilize 3D-geometry information about the observed scene as a postverification step. In this paper we propose to use the 3D-scene information from sparse-visual feature maps directly at the core of the place recognition pipeline. We propose a novel structural descriptor which aggregates sparse triangulated landmarks from SLAM into a compact signature. The resulting 3Dfeatures provide a discriminative fingerprint to recognize places over seasonal and viewpoint changes which are particularly challenging for approaches based on sparse visual descriptors.

We then provide a gradientbased optimization technique that optimizes continuous-time trajectories with respect to a cost functional. By exploiting GP interpolation, we develop the Gaussian Process Motion Planner (GPMP), that finds optimal trajectories parameterized by a small number of states. We benchmark our algorithm against recent trajectory optimization algorithms by solving 7-DOF robotic arm planning problems in simulation and validate our approach on a real 7-DOF WAM arm.},

One challenge is that demonstrated trajectories may vary dramatically: it can be very difficult, if not impossible, for a system to learn control policies unless the trajectories are clustered into meaningful consistent subsets. Metric clustering methods, based on a distance measure, require quadratic time to compute a pairwise distance matrix and do not naturally distinguish topologically distinct trajectories. This paper presents an algorithm for topological clustering based on relative persistent homology, which, for a fixed underlying simplicial representation and discretization of trajectories, requires only linear time in the number of trajectories. The algorithm incorporates global constraints formalized in terms of the topology of sublevel or superlevel sets of a function and can be extended to incorporate probabilistic motion models. In experiments with real automobile and ship GPS trajectories as well as pedestrian trajectories extracted from video, the algorithm clusters trajectories into meaningful consistent subsets and, as we show in an experiment with ship trajectories, results in a faster and more efficient clustering than a metric clustering by Frechet distance.},

The approach learns a codeword in the bagof-words model from a pair of matched features from two consecutive frames, such that the codeword has temporallyderived perspective invariance to camera motion. The learning algorithm is efficient: the binary descriptor is generated from the mean image patch, and the mask is learned based on discriminative projection by minimizing the intra-class distances among the learned feature and the two original features. A codeword is generated by packaging the learned descriptor and mask, with a masked Hamming distance defined to measure the distance between two codewords. The geometric properties of the learned codewords are then mathematically justified. In addition, hypothesis constraints are imposed through temporal consistency in matched codewords, which improves precision. The approach, integrated in an incremental bag-of-words system, is validated on multiple benchmark data sets and compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments demonstrate improved precision/recall outperforming state of the art with little loss in runtime.},

This paper proposes a probabilistic approach to stereo visual odometry based on the combination of both point and line segment that works robustly in a wide variety of scenarios. The camera motion is recovered through non-linear minimization of the projection errors of both point and line segment features. In order to effectively combine both types of features, their associated errors are weighted according to their covariance matrices, computed from the propagation of Gaussian distribution errors in the sensor measurements. The method, of course, is computationally more expensive that using only one type of feature, but still can run in real-time on a standard computer and provides interesting advantages, including a straightforward integration into any probabilistic framework commonly employed in mobile robotics.},

  abstract      = {We consider the problem of understanding the 3D layout of indoor corridor scenes from a single image in real time. Identifying obstacles such as walls is essential for robot navigation, but also challenging due to the diversity in structure, appearance and illumination of real-world corridor scenes. Many current single-image methods make Manhattanworld assumptions, and break down in environments that do not meet this mold. They also may require complicated handdesigned features for image segmentation or clear boundaries to form certain building models. In addition, most cannot run in real time. In this paper, we propose to combine machine learning with geometric modelling to build a simplified 3D model from a single image. We first employ a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to provide a dense, but coarse, geometric class labelling of the scene. We then refine this labelling with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF). Finally, we fit line segments along wall-ground boundaries and pop up a 3D model using geometric constraints. We assemble a dataset of 967 labelled corridor images. Our experiments on this dataset and another publicly available dataset show our method outperforms other single image scene understanding methods in pixelwise accuracy while labelling images at over 15 Hz.},

Our framework automatically learns to organize object names into a semantic hierarchy using crowdsourcing and background knowledge bases. It then uses the hierarchy to improve the consistency and efficiency of annotating objects. It also adapts information from additional image datasets to learn object classifiers from a very small number of training examples. We present experiments to test the performance of the adaptation method and demonstrate the full system in a never-ending object learning experiment.},

A particularly useful representation in computer vision is a spatiotemporal video segmentation. Together with motion, knowledge of depth can substantially improve superpixel segmentation. In this work we present a novel framework for spatio-temporal segmentation from RGBD video. The method employs both low-level (intensity, color) and high-level (deformable parts model) appearance features. Motion is incorporated through the use of optical flow to construct the temporal connections in the graph Laplacian. Depth cues are incorporated in the similarity metric to provide an informative cue for object boundaries at depth disparities. Nave application of spectral clustering to dense spatio-temporal graphs leads to a high computational cost that is typically addressed through the use of GPUs or computer clusters. By contrast, we build upon a recently proposed Nystrom approximation strategy for spatiotemporal clustering that enables computation on a single core. We further explore structured local connectivity patterns to give high performance at low computational cost. Also we propose a novel context-aware aggregation method that uses a deformable parts model to group the detected parts of the object as a single segment with an accurate boundary. Detailed experiments on the NYU Depth Dataset and TUM RGBD Dataset is performed to compare against previous large-scale graph-based spatiotemporal segmentation techniques which shows the substantial performance advantages of our framework.},

We propose an algorithm that rectifies for these RS and MB distortions. To assess the performance of the algorithm we conduct an extensive set of experiments for each step of the pipeline. We assess the performance of our algorithm by comparing the performance of the rectified images on scene-flow and camera pose estimation, and show that with our proposed rectification, the performance improvement is significant.},

We incorporate LIDAR by up-sampling the point cloud to a dense depth map and then extracting three features representing different aspects of the 3D scene. We then use those features as extra image channels. Specifically, we leverage recent work on HHA [9] (horizontal disparity, height above ground, and angle) representations, adapting the code to work on up-sampled LIDAR rather than Microsoft Kinect depth maps. We show, for the first time, that such a representation is applicable to up-sampled LIDAR data, despite its sparsity. Since CNNs learn a deep hierarchy of feature representations, we then explore the question: At what level of representation should we fuse this additional information with the original RGB image channels? We use the KITTI pedestrian detection dataset for our exploration. We first replicate the finding that region-CNNs (R-CNNs) [8] can outperform the original proposal mechanism using only RGB images, but only if fine-tuning is employed. Then, we show that: 1) using HHA features and RGB images performs better than RGB-only, even without any fine-tuning using large RGB web data, 2) fusing RGB and HHA achieves the strongest results if done late, but, under a parameter or computational budget, is best done at the early to middle layers of the hierarchical representation, which tend to represent midlevel features rather than low (e.g. edges) or high (e.g. object class decision) level features, 3) some of the less successful methods have the most parameters, indicating that increased classification accuracy is not simply a function of increased capacity in the neural network.},

  abstract      = {Sampling-based optimal planners, such as RRT*, almost-surely converge asymptotically to the optimal solution, but have provably slow convergence rates in high dimensions. This is because their commitment to finding the global optimum compels them to prioritize exploration of the entire problem domain even as its size grows exponentially. Optimization techniques, such as CHOMP, have fast convergence on these problems but only to local optima. This is because they are exploitative, prioritizing the immediate improvement of a path even though this may not find the global optimum of nonconvex cost functions. In this paper, we present a hybrid technique that integrates the benefits of both methods into a single search. A key insight is that applying local optimization to a subset of edges likely to improve the solution avoids the prohibitive cost of optimizing every edge in a global search. This is made possible by Batch Informed Trees (BIT*), an informed global technique that orders its search by potential solution quality. In our algorithm, Regionally Accelerated BIT* (RABIT*), we extend BIT* by using optimization to exploit local domain information and find alternative connections for edges in collision and accelerate the search. This improves search performance in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes (e.g., narrow passages) while maintaining almost-sure asymptotic convergence to the global optimum. Our experiments on simulated random worlds and real data from an autonomous helicopter show that on certain difficult problems, RABIT* converges 1.8 times faster than BIT*. Qualitatively, in problems with difficult-to-sample homotopy classes, we show that RABIT* is able to efficiently transform paths to avoid obstacles.},

In this paper, we propose an alternative to traditional point-features: we train place-specific linear SVM classifiers to recognise distinctive elements in the environment. The core contribution of this paper is an unsupervised mining algorithm which operates on a single mapping dataset to extract distinct elements from the environment for localisation. We evaluate our system on 205 km of data collected from central Oxford over a period of six months in bright sun, night, rain, snow and at all times of the day. Our experiment consists of a comprehensive N-vs-N analysis on 22 laps of the approximately 10 km route in central Oxford.

Specifically, in the context of scene understanding for roads, 3D vehicle detection and tracking from monocular videos still needs a lot of attention to enable practical applications. Current approaches leverage two kinds of information to deal with the vehicle detection and tracking problem: (1) 3D representations (eg. wireframe models or voxel based or CAD models) for diverse vehicle skeletal structures learnt from data, and (2) classifiers trained to detect vehicles or vehicle parts in single images built on top of a basic feature extraction step. In this paper, we propose to extend current approaches in two ways. First, we extend detection to a multiple view setting. We show that leveraging information given by feature or part detectors in multiple images can lead to more accurate detection results than single image detection. Secondly, we show that given multiple images of a vehicle, we can also leverage 3D information from the scene generated using a unique structure from motion algorithm. This helps us localize the vehicle in 3D, and constrain the parameters of optimization for fitting the 3D model to image data. We show results on the KITTI dataset, and demonstrate superior results compared with recent state-of-theart methods, with upto 14.64 \% improvement in localization error.},

We provide a performance analysis in image matching and structure from motion benchmarks, showing calibration results in visual odometry and object recognition problems.

To confirm the theoretical observations, we implement a stateof-the-art VO pipeline that works with large FoV fisheye and catadioptric cameras. We evaluate the proposed VO pipeline in both synthetic and real experiments.

However, this is not feasible if on-line (re-)calibration is necessary or the sensor setup is inaccessible, e.g., for already captured datasets. Instead of using specific calibration patterns, we propose to leverage a sparse environment model as geometric prior for the calibration. Structure-from-motion or SLAM can provide such a sparse 3D scene model, and hence our approach allows for self-calibration without the need for any manual interaction. We validate our hypothesis by introducing an optimization that jointly minimizes the alignment error between the sparse map and all recorded depth maps. Since the accuracy of depth measurements is known to degrade considerably with scene depth, we account for this distortion via a spatially varying correction term. The evaluation of our approach demonstrates that we are able to compute an accurate extrinsic and intrinsic calibration, which for example allows dense 3D modeling at improved precision.},

Using spectral vegetation signatures to discriminate between crop and weed species has been demonstrated on several occasions in the literature over the past 15 years. A number of authors demonstrated successful per-pixel classification with accuracies of over 80\%. However, the vast majority of the related literature uses supervised methods, where training datasets have been manually compiled. In practice, static training data can be particularly susceptible to temporal variability due to physiological or environmental change. A self-supervised training method that leverages prior knowledge about seeding patterns in vegetable fields has recently been introduced in the context of RGB imaging, allowing the classifier to continually update weed appearance models as conditions change. This paper combines and extends these methods to provide a selfsupervised framework for hyperspectral crop/weed discrimination with prior knowledge of seeding patterns using an autonomous mobile ground vehicle. Experimental results in corn crop rows demonstrate the systems performance and limitations.},

In this work, we propose a high-performance and tunable stereo disparity estimation method, with a peak frame-rate of 120Hz (VGA resolution, on a single CPU-thread), that can potentially enable robots to quickly reconstruct their immediate surroundings and maneuver at high-speeds. Our key contribution is a disparity estimation algorithm that iteratively approximates the scene depth via a piece-wise planar mesh from stereo imagery, with a fast depth validation step for semidense reconstruction. The mesh is initially seeded with sparsely matched keypoints, and is recursively tessellated and refined as needed (via a resampling stage), to provide the desired stereo disparity accuracy. The inherent simplicity and speed of our approach, with the ability to tune it to a desired reconstruction quality and runtime performance makes it a compelling solution for applications in high-speed vehicles.},

Especially autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles require good pose estimates at comparably high frequencies. In this paper, we propose an effective system for online pose and simultaneous map estimation designed for light-weight UAVs. Our system consists of two components: (1) real-time pose estimation combining RTK-GPS and IMU at 100 Hz and (2) an effective SLAM solution running at 10 Hz using image data from an omnidirectional multifisheye-camera system. The SLAM procedure combines spatial resection computed based on the map that is incrementally refined through bundle adjustment and combines the image data with raw GPS observations and IMU data on keyframes. The overall system yields a real-time, georeferenced pose at 100 Hz in GPS-friendly situations. Additionally, we obtain a precise pose and feature map at 10 Hz even in cases where the GPS is not observable or underconstrained. Our system has been implemented and thoroughly tested on a 5 kg copter and yields accurate and reliable pose estimation at high frequencies. We compare the point cloud obtained by our method with a model generated from georeferenced terrestrial laser scanner.},

Furthermore, our formulation allows for modularity since new/old maps (or parts of them) can be easily added/removed with no impact on the remaining ones. Additionally, the proposed CM algorithm lends itself, for the most part, to parallel implementations, hence gaining in speed. Experimental results based on visual and inertial measurements collected from four users within two large buildings are used to assess the performance of the proposed CM algorithm.},

In each planning epoch, a short-range planner uses a local map to generate a new trajectory. At the same time, a safe stopping policy is found. This allows the robot to come to an emergency halt when necessary. Our algorithm guarantees collision avoidance and demonstrates important advances in real-time planning. First, our novel short range planning method allows us to generate and re-plan trajectories that are dynamically feasible, comply with state and input constraints, and avoid obstacles in real-time. Further, previous planning algorithms abstract away the obstacle detection problem by assuming the instantaneous availability of geometric information about the environment. In contrast, our method addresses the challenge of using the raw sensor data to form a map and navigate in real-time. Finally, in addition to simulation examples, we provide physical experiments that demonstrate the entire algorithmic pipeline from obstacle detection to trajectory execution.},

In contrast to prior art, our system is able to predict this localisation envelope for trajectories in similar, yet geographically distant locations where no repeat runs have yet been performed. Thus, by characterising the localisation performance in one region, we are able to predict performance in another. To achieve this, we leverage a Gaussian Process regressor to estimate the likely number of feature matches for any keyframe in the teach run, based on a combination of trajectory properties such as curvature and an appearance model of the keyframe. Using data from real traversals, we demonstrate that our approach performs as well as prior art when it comes to interpolating localisation performance based on a number of repeat runs, while also performing well at generalising performance estimation to freshly taught trajectories.},

We focus in particular on the case of survey construction with a push broom laser + VO system. Here visual odometry is combined with vertical 2D scans to create a 3D picture of the environment. A key characteristic here is that the sensors pass/sweep swiftly through the environment such that elements of the scene are seen only briefly by cameras and scanned just once by the laser. These qualities make for a an ill-constrained optimisation problem which is greatly aided if architectural constraints can be discovered and appropriately applied. We demonstrate our approach in an end-to-end implementation which discovers salient architectural constraints and rejects false loop closures before invoking an optimisation to return a 3D model of the workspace. We evaluate the precision of this model by comparison to a ground truth provided by a 3rd party professional survey using highend (static) 3D laser scanners.},

When object observations are available, the local scale of the map is then determined jointly with the camera pose in local adjustments. Unlike many previous visual odometry methods, our approach does not impose restrictions such as approximately constant camera height or planar roadways, and is therefore applicable to a much wider range of applications. We evaluate our approach on the KITTI dataset and show that it reduces scale drift over long-range outdoor sequences with a total length of 40 km.

To overcome these issues, we propose a two-stage system that performs per-pixel segmentation followed by region detection. The output of the segmentation is used to search for highly probable regions and declares these to be sweet pepper. We propose the novel use of the local binary pattern (LBP) to perform crop segmentation. This feature improves the accuracy of crop segmentation from an AUC of 0.10, for previously proposed features, to 0.56. Using the LBP feature as the basis for our two-stage algorithm, we are able to detect 69.2\% of field grown sweet peppers in three sites.

We propose a fruit detection algorithm that utilizes the gradual variation of intensity and gradient orientation on the surface of the fruit. Candidate fruit locations, or seed points are tested for both monotonically decreasing intensity and gradient orientation profiles. Candidate fruit locations that pass the initial filter are classified using modified histogram of oriented gradients combined with a pairwise intensity comparison texture descriptor and random forest classifier.

Our system first extracts keypoints from RGB images and generates 2D and 3D point features from the keypoints with invalid and valid depth values, respectively. It then establishes 3D-to-3D, 2D-to-3D, and 2D-to-2D point correspondences among frames. For the 2D-to-3D point correspondences, we use the rays defined by the 2D point features to pinpoint the corresponding 3D point features, generating longer-range constraints than using only 3D-to-3D correspondences. For the 2D-to-2D point correspondences, we triangulate the rays to generate 3D points that are used as 3D point features in the subsequent process. We use the hybrid correspondences in both online SLAM and offline postprocessing: the online SLAM focuses more on the speed by computing correspondences among consecutive frames for real-time operations, while the offline postprocessing generates more correspondences among all the frames for higher accuracy. The results on RGB-D SLAM benchmarks show that the online SLAM provides higher accuracy than conventional SLAM systems, while the postprocessing further improves the accuracy.},

To address this problem, we introduce the expected residual likelihood method (ERL), which estimates confidence weights for noisy optical flow data using likelihood distributions of the residuals of the flow field under a range of counterfactual model parameters. We show that ERL is effective at identifying outliers and recovering appropriate confidence weights in many settings. We compare ERL to a novel formulation of the perspective camera motion equation using a lifted kernel, a recently proposed optimization framework for joint parameter and confidence weight estimation with good empirical properties. We incorporate these strategies into a motion estimation pipeline that avoids falling into local minima. We find that ERL outperforms the lifted kernel method and baseline monocular egomotion estimation strategies on the challenging KITTI dataset, while adding almost no runtime cost over baseline egomotion methods.},

Our experiments in simulation and a human-robot workspace sharing study compare a cost function that uses only the first factor and a combined cost that uses both factors vs. a baseline method that is perfectly consistent but does not account for the humans previous motion. We find that using either cost function we outperform the baseline method in terms of task success rate without degrading the task completion time. The best task success rate is achieved with the cost function that includes both the avoidance and consistency terms.},

In a rolling shutter camera, the pose is different for each row of each image, and this yields poor pose estimates and poor structure estimates when using a state-of-the-art semi-dense direct method designed for global shutter cameras. To address this issue in tracking, we model the smooth and continuous camera trajectory using a B-spline curve of degree k1 for poses in the Lie algebra, se(3). We solve for the camera poses at each row-time by a direct optimisation of photometric error as a function of the control points of the spline. Likewise for mapping, we develop generalised epipolar geometry for the rolling shutter case and solve for point depths using photometric error. Although each of these issues has been previously tackled, to the best of our knowledge ours is the first full solution to monocular, direct (feature-less) SLAM.

Incremental solvers are able to process incoming sensor data and produce maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates in realtime by exploiting the natural sparsity within the graph for reasonable-sized problems. However, to enable truly longterm operation in prior unknown environments requires algorithms whose computation, memory, and bandwidth (in the case of distributed systems) requirements scale constantly with time and environment size. Some recent approaches have addressed this problem through a two-step process - first the variables selected for removal are marginalized which induces density, and then the result is sparsified to maintain computational efficiency. Previous literature generally addresses only one of these two components. In this work, we attempt to explicitly connect all of the aforementioned resource constraint requirements by considering the node removal and sparsification pipeline in its entirety. We formulate the node selection problem as a minimization problem over the penalty to be paid in the resulting sparsification. As a result, we produce node subset selection strategies that are optimal in terms of minimizing the impact, in terms of Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD), of approximating the dense distribution by a sparse one. We then show that one instantiation of this problem yields a computationally tractable formulation.

We assume that the robot is equipped with a depth sensor and given a database of 3D object models and their grasping poses, but yet there is uncertainty about objects class and pose. In this paper, we study the problem of how to predict the class and pose of an occluded object by carefully taking a sequence of observations. To find the best sequence of viewpoints by the robot, we construct hypotheses of the states of the target and occluding objects, and update our belief state as new observations come in. Every time selecting the next robot pose, we greedily choose the one that is expected to reduce the uncertainty the most. Based on the theoretical analysis of adaptive submodular maximization problems, this process is guaranteed to find a near-optimal sequence of robot poses in terms of observation and traverse costs. To validate the proposed method, we present simulation and robot experiments using a PR2.},

The 6DOF pose of the sweet peppers is then estimated via a nonlinear least squares optimisation by fitting a superellipsoid to the segmented sweet pepper. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a real 6DOF manipulator with a custom gripper. The method is shown to estimate the 6DOF pose successfully enabling the manipulator to grasp sweet peppers for a range of different orientations. The results obtained improve largely on the performance of grasping when compared to a naive approach, which does not estimate the orientation of the crop.},

This assumption holds when images are taken from high-altitudes (hence the depth variation is negligible). It is often violated when flying at low altitudes. Further, to avoid scale and resolution changes, existing methods rely on primarily translational motion at fixed altitudes. Our method removes these limitations and performs well even when aerial images are taken from low altitudes by an aerial vehicle performing complex motions. It starts by extracting the ground geometry from a sparse reconstruction of the scene obtained from a small fraction of the input images. Next, it selects the best image (from the entire sequence) for each location on the ground using a novel camera selection criterion. This image is then independently rectified to obtain the corresponding portion of the mosaic. Therefore, the technique avoids performing costly joint-optimization over the entire sequence. It is validated using challenging input sequences motivated by agricultural applications.},

  abstract      = {Precisely estimating the pose of an agent in a global reference frame is a crucial goal that unlocks a multitude of robotic applications, including autonomous navigation and collaboration. In order to achieve this, current state-ofthe-art localization approaches collect data provided by one or more agents and create a single, consistent localization map, maintained over time. However, with the introduction of lengthier sorties and the growing size of the environments, data transfers between the backend server where the global map is stored and the agents are becoming prohibitively large. While some existing methods partially address this issue by building compact summary maps, the data transfer from the agents to the backend can still easily become unmanageable. In this paper, we propose a method that is designed to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred from the agent to the backend, functioning in large-scale, multisession mapping scenarios. Our approach is based upon a landmark selection method that exploits information coming from multiple, possibly weak and correlated, landmark utility predictors; fused using learned feature coefficients. Such a selection yields a drastic reduction in data transfer while maintaining localization performance and the ability to efficiently summarize environments over time. We evaluate our approach on a data set that was autonomously collected in a dynamic indoor environment over a period of several months.},

However, connectivity over a mobile network imposes strict bandwidth constraints and thus the need to minimize the amount of exchanged data. The wide range of varying appearance conditions encountered during long-term visual localization offers the potential to reduce data usage by extracting only those visual cues which are relevant at the given time. Motivated by this, we propose an unsupervised method of adaptively selecting landmarks according to how likely these landmarks are to be observable under the prevailing appearance condition. The ranking function this selection is based upon exploits landmark co-observability statistics collected in past traversals through the mapped area. Evaluation is performed over different outdoor environments, large time-scales and varying appearance conditions, including the extreme transition from day-time to night-time, demonstrating that with our appearance-dependent selection method, we can significantly reduce the amount of landmarks used for localization while maintaining or even improving the localization performance.},

Unlike previous attempts at solving the problem of illumination invariant representation, the proposed method does not assume the ideal narrow-band color camera nor a calibration step for each environment. We evaluate our method on real datasets to establish its accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results show that our method outperforms competing methods for illumination invariant image representation.},

These points are continuously matched against the map to track the camera pose in an online fashion. Our approach to visual localization has several advantages. Since it only relies on matching geometry, it is robust to changes in the photometric appearance of the environment. Utilizing panoramic LiDAR maps additionally provides viewpoint invariance.

However, these methods struggle with long-term, outdoor operation due to the challenges of environmental appearance change caused by lighting, weather, and seasons. While techniques exist to address appearance change by using multiple experiences over different environmental conditions, they either provide topological-only localization, require several manually taught experiences in different conditions, or require extensive offline mapping to produce metric localization. For real-world use, we would like to localize metrically to a single manually taught route and gather additional visual experiences during autonomous operations. Accordingly, we propose a novel multi-experience localization (MEL) algorithm developed specifically for routefollowing applications; it provides continuous, six-degree-offreedom (6DoF) localization with relative uncertainty to a privileged (manually taught) path using several experiences simultaneously. We validate our algorithm through two experiments: i) an offline performance analysis on a 9km subset of a challenging 27km route-traversal dataset and ii) an online field trial where we demonstrate autonomy on a small 250m loop over the course of a sunny day. Both exhibit significant appearance change due to lighting variation. Through these experiments we show that safe localization can be achieved by bridging the appearance gap.},

We then reformulate the self-localization as a scalable bag-ofvisual-features (BoVF) scene retrieval and present an efficient solution called PCA-NBNN, aiming to facilitate fast and yet discriminative correspondence between partially overlapping images. The proposed approach adopts recent findings in discriminativity preserving encoding of DCNN features using principal component analysis (PCA) and cross-domain scene matching using naive Bayes nearest neighbor distance metric (NBNN). We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed PCA-NBNN framework frequently achieves comparable results to previous DCNN features and that the BoVF model is significantly more efficient. We further address an important alternative scenario of self-localization from images with NO overlap and report the result.},

The most used approach to point clouds registration, Iterative Closest Point (ICP), is also applicable to this sub-problem. We propose an improvement over the standard ICP data association policy and we called it Probabilistic Data Association. It was derived applying statistical inference techniques on a fully probabilistic model. In our proposal, each point in the source point cloud is associated with a set of points in the target point cloud; each association is then weighted so that the weights form a probability distribution. The result is an algorithm similar to ICP but more robust w.r.t. noise and outliers. While we designed our approach to deal with the problem of dense-sparse registration, it can be successfully applied also to standard point clouds registration.},

For machine learning applications a critical bottleneck is the limited amount of real world image data that can be captured and labelled for both training and testing purposes. In this paper we investigate the use of a photo-realistic simulation tool to address these challenges, in three specific domains: robust place recognition, visual SLAM and object recognition. For the first two problems we generate images from a complex 3D environment with systematically varying camera paths, camera viewpoints and lighting conditions. For the first time we are able to systematically characterise the performance of these algorithms as paths and lighting conditions change. In particular, we are able to systematically generate varying camera viewpoint datasets that would be difficult or impossible to generate in the real world. We also compare algorithm results for a camera in a real environment and a simulated camera in a simulation model of that real environment. Finally, for the object recognition domain, we generate labelled image data and characterise the viewpoint dependency of a current convolution neural network in performing object recognition. Together these results provide a multi-domain demonstration of the beneficial properties of using simulation to characterise and analyse a wide range of robotic vision algorithms.},

A particularly important representation is the truncated signed distance field (TSDF) that is at the core of recent advances in dense 3D mapping. However, there is relatively little literature exploring the characteristics of 3D feature detection in volumetric representations. In this paper we evaluate the performance of features extracted directly from a 3D TSDF representation. We compare the repeatability of Integral invariant features, specifically designed for volumetric images, to the 3D extensions of Harris and Shi & Tomasi corners. We also study the impact of different methods for obtaining gradients for their computation. We motivate our study with an example application for building sparse stable scene graphs, and present an efficient GPU-parallel algorithm to obtain the graphs, made possible by the combination of TSDF and 3D feature points. Our findings show that while the 3D extensions of 2D corner-detection perform as expected, integral invariants have shortcomings when applied to discrete TSDFs. We conclude with a discussion of the cause for these points of failure that sheds light on possible mitigation strategies.},

Existing methods typically exploit image sequences, holistic descriptors and/or training data. Each of these approaches limits the practical applicability, e.g. to constant viewpoints for usage of holistic image descriptors. Recently, the combination of local region detectors and descriptors based on Convolutional Neural Networks showed to be a promising approach to overcome these limitations. However, established region detectors, for example keypoint detectors, showed severe problems to provide repetitive landmarks despite dramatically changed appearance of the environment. Thus, they are typically replaced by holistic image descriptors or fixedly arranged patches - both known to be sensitive towards viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present a novel local region detector, SP-Grid, that is particularly suited for the combination of severe appearance and viewpoint changes. It is based on multi-scale image oversegmentations and is designed to combine the advantages of keypoints and fixed image patches by starting from an initial grid-like arrangement and subsequently adapting to the image content. The gridlike arrangement showed to be beneficial in the presence of severe appearance changes and the adaptation to the image content increases the robustness towards viewpoint changes. The experimental evaluation will show the benefit compared to existing local region detectors and holistic image descriptors.},

The sought static-map consists of only the static scene parts, which has a vital role in scene understanding and landmark based navigation. Building static-map requires the categorization of moving and static objects. In this work, we propose a Sparse Subspace Clustering-based Motion Segmentation method that categories the static scene parts and the multiple moving objects using their 3D motion trajectories. Our motion segmentation method uses the raw trajectory data, allowing the objects to move in direct 3D space, without any projection model assumption or whatsoever. We also propose a complete pipeline for static-map building which estimates the inter-frame motion parameters by exploiting the minimal 3-point Random Sample Consensus algorithm on the feature correspondences only from the static scene parts. The proposed method has been especially designed and tested for large scene in real outdoor environments. On one hand, our 3D Motion Segmentation approach outperforms its 2D based counterparts, for extensive experiments on KITTI dataset. On the other hand, separately reconstructed static-maps and moving objects for various dynamic scenes are very satisfactory.},

Operating on a plane-based representation of a point cloud, our method does not require a final smoothing step and achieves state-of-the-art results on the NYU Depth Dataset in a single inference step. This compactness in turn allows for fast processing times, a crucial factor to consider for online applications on robotic platforms.

The first task objective aims to maximize detection and minimize false alarms so as to ensure the arm is directed only towards real fruits. The second task objective focuses on high accuracy in the detection. Intensive evaluations were conducted on databases which contained 240 images acquired in the field with various artificial illumination setups.

The system is based on a manipulator which facilitates reaching multiple detection poses. Several detection algorithms are developed based on principal component analysis (PCA) and the coefficient of variation (CV). Tests ascertain the system can successfully detect the plant and reach the detection pose required for PM (along the side of the plant), yet it has difficulties in reaching the TSWV detection pose (above the plant). Increasing manipulator workvolume is expected to solve this issue. For TSWV, PCA-based classification with leaf vein removal, achieved the highest classification accuracy (90\%) while the accuracy of the CV methods was also high (85\%, 87\%). For PM, PCA-based pixellevel classification was high (95.2\%) while leaf condition classification accuracy was low (64.3\%) since it was determined based on the upper side of the leaf while disease symptoms start on its lower side. Exposure of the lower side of the leaf during detection is expected to improve PM condition detection.},

This assumption holds when images are taken from high-altitudes (hence the depth variation is negligible). It is often violated when flying at low altitudes. Further, to avoid scale and resolution changes, existing methods rely on primarily translational motion at fixed altitudes. Our method removes these limitations and performs well even when aerial images are taken from low altitudes by an aerial vehicle performing complex motions. It starts by extracting the ground geometry from a sparse reconstruction of the scene obtained from a small fraction of the input images. Next, it selects the best image (from the entire sequence) for each location on the ground using a novel camera selection criterion. This image is then independently rectified to obtain the corresponding portion of the mosaic. Therefore, the technique avoids performing costly joint-optimization over the entire sequence. It is validated using challenging input sequences motivated by agricultural applications.},

The first strictly thresholds action selection based on these metrics, forcing the planner to find a solution that lies within a contraction region over which all initial conditions converge exponentially to a single trajectory. However, finding such a monotonically contracting plan is not always possible. Thus, we propose a second method that relaxes these strict requirements to find convergent (i.e. low-divergence) plans. The third algorithm uses these metrics for post-planning path selection. Two examples test the ability of these metrics to lead the planners to more robust trajectories: a mobile robot climbing a hill and a manipulator rearranging objects on a table.},

In contrast to classical cameras, however, fisheye cameras cannot be approximated well using the pinhole camera model and this renders the computation of depth information from fisheye stereo image pairs more complicated. In this work, we analyze the combination of an epipolar rectification model for fisheye stereo cameras with existing dense methods. This has the advantage that existing dense stereo systems can be applied as a black-box even with cameras that have field of view of more than 180 deg to obtain dense disparity information. We thoroughly investigate the accuracy potential of such fisheye stereo systems using image data from our UAV. The empirical analysis is based on image pairs of a calibrated fisheye stereo camera system and two state-of-the-art algorithms for dense stereo applied to adequately rectified image pairs from fisheye stereo cameras. The canonical stochastic model for sensor points assumes homogeneous uncertainty and we generalize this model based on an empirical analysis using a test scene consisting of mutually orthogonal planes. We show (1) that the combination of adequately rectified fisheye image pairs and dense methods provides dense 3D point clouds at 6-7 Hz on our autonomous multi-copter UAV, (2) that the uncertainty of points depends on their angular distance from the optical axis, (3) how to estimate the variance component as a function of that distance, and (4) how the improved stochastic model improves the accuracy of the scene points.},

In order to compute image motion for modern highly dynamic robots, it is necessary to use high speed vision systems. To perceive small and thin objects such as tree branches, fence poles, and other similar objects, high resolution vision systems must be used. The data stream from a high-resolution, high-speed vision system will saturate the onboard data bus and overload the onboard processor of almost all existing robotic systems. To implement such a vision system, we believe it is necessary to process the data in situ at the camera using dedicated processing hardware, a vision processing paradigm that we term Rapid Embedded Vision (REV) systems. Even then, the task of processing multiple hundred hertz of dense high-resolution images is not possible using classical algorithms and classical computing hardware. A new processing paradigm that actively exploits the high frame rate of the image sequences, and high performance computing hardware such as GPU or FPGA must be employed. This paper proposes a filtering algorithm for the computation of dense optical flow fields in real time. The filter is designed as a pyramidal structure of update and propagation loops, where an optical flow state is constantly refined with new image data from the camera. The computational properties of the proposed algorithm makes it well suited for implementation in GPU and FPGA systems. We present results from a GPU implementation achieving frame rates in the order of 800 Hz at VGA resolution. Experimental validation and comparison is provided for both synthetic and real life high speed video sequences at frame rates of 300 Hz and 1016 544 pixel resolution.},

In the last decade, impressive results have been demonstrated in the context of visual navigation, reaching very high localization performance. However, all ego-motion estimation systems require careful parameter tuning procedures for the specific environment they have to work in. Furthermore, even in ideal scenarios, most state-of-the-art approaches fail to handle image anomalies and imperfections, which results in less robust estimates. VO systems that rely on geometrical approaches extract sparse or dense features and match them to perform Frame to Frame (F2F) motion estimation. However, images contain much more information that can be used to further improve the F2F estimation. To learn new feature representation a very successful approach is to use deep Convolutional Neural Networks. Inspired by recent advances in Deep Networks and by previous work on learning methods applied to VO, we explore the use of Convolutional Neural Networks to learn both the best visual features and the best estimator for the task of visual Ego-Motion Estimation. With experiments on publicly available datasets we show that our approach is robust with respect to blur, luminance and contrast anomalies and outperforms most state-of-the-art approaches even in nominal conditions.},

In search and rescue missions, which are our target scenarios, the time from arrival at the disaster site to the delivery of aid is critically important. Previous works required exhaustive exploration before path planning, which is time-consuming but eventually leads to an optimal path for the ground robot. Instead, we propose active exploration of the environment, where the flying robot chooses regions to map in a way that optimizes the overall response time of the system, which is the combined time for the air and ground robots to execute their missions. In our approach, we estimate terrain classes throughout our terrain map, and we also add elevation information in areas where the active exploration algorithm has chosen to perform 3D reconstruction. This terrain information is used to estimate feasible and efficient paths for the ground robot. By exploring the environment actively, we achieve superior response times compared to both exhaustive and greedy exploration strategies. We demonstrate the performance and capabilities of the proposed system in simulated and real-world outdoor experiments. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to address ground robot path planning using active aerial exploration.},

In the second problem, we account for the complication of the robots perception noise using Warped Gaussian Processes (WGPs). This approach allows for non-Gaussian noise in the observation space and captures the possible nonlinearity in that space better than standard GPs. The developed techniques can be applied separately or concurrently to a standard GP occupancy mapping problem.

Accurate peduncle detection in 3D space is therefore a vital step in reliable autonomous harvesting of sweet peppers, as this can lead to precise cutting while avoiding damage to the surrounding plant. This paper makes use of both colour and geometry information acquired from an RGB-D sensor and utilises a supervised-learning approach for the peduncle detection task.

  abstract      = {Autonomous mobile robots perform many tasks, such as grasping and inspection, that may require complete models of 3D objects in the environment. If little or no knowledge about an object is known a priori, the robot must take sensor measurements from strategically determined viewpoints in order to reconstruct a 3D model of the object. We propose an autonomous object reconstruction approach for mobile robots that is very general, with no assumptions about object shape or size, such as a bounding box or predetermined set of candidate viewpoints. A probabilistic, volumetric method for determining the optimal next best view is developed based on a partial model of a 3D object of unknown shape and size. The proposed method integrates an object probability characteristic to determine sensor views that incrementally reconstruct a 3D model of the object. Experiments in simulation and on a real world robot validate the work and compare it to the state of the art.},

Our approach combines effective vision algorithms with a novel end-effector design to enable successful harvesting of sweet peppers. Initial field trials in protected cropping environments, with two cultivar, demonstrate the efficacy of this approach achieving a 46\% success rate for unmodified crop, and 58\% for modified crop. Furthermore, for the more favourable cultivar we were also able to detach 90\% of sweet peppers, indicating that improvements in the grasping success rate would result in greatly improved harvesting performance.},

  abstract      = {This paper describes a fruit counting pipeline based on deep learning that accurately counts fruit in unstructured environments. Obtaining reliable fruit counts is challenging because of variations in appearance due to illumination changes and occlusions from foliage and neighboring fruits. We propose a novel approach that uses deep learning to map from input images to total fruit counts. The pipeline utilizes a custom crowd-sourcing platform to quickly label large data sets. A blob detector based on a fully convolutional network extracts candidate regions in the images. A counting algorithm based on a second convolutional network then estimates the number of fruit in each region. Finally, a linear regression model maps that fruit count estimate to a final fruit count. We analyze the performance of the pipeline on two distinct data sets of oranges in daylight, and green apples at night, utilizing human generated labels as ground truth. We also show that the pipeline has a short training time and performs well with a limited data set size. Our method generalizes across both data sets and is able to perform well even on highly occluded fruits that are challenging for human labelers to annotate.},

Instead, our approach achieves more accurate results by eliminating the inconsistencies resulting from distortions affecting the inputs, and can succeed in those situations where traditional approaches fail for substantial deformations. The core idea behind our solution is to localize the robot in a reference map by using the data from another map as observations. We validated our approach on publicly available datasets, and provide quantitative results that confirm its effectiveness on challenging instances of the merging problem.},

  keywords      = {Localization, Recognition, SLAM},
  abstract      = {We address in this paper the problem of loop closure detection for laser-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) of very large areas. Consistent with the state of the art, the map is encoded as a graph of poses, and to cope with very large mapping capabilities, loop closures are asserted by comparing the features extracted from a query laser scan against a previously acquired corpus of scan features using a bag-of-words (BoW) scheme. Two contributions are here presented. First, to benefit from the graph topology, feature frequency scores in the BoW are computed not only for each individual scan but also from neighboring scans in the SLAM graph. This has the effect of enforcing neighbor relational information during document matching. Secondly, a weak geometric check that takes into account feature ordering and occlusions is introduced that substantially improves loop closure detection performance. The two contributions are evaluated both separately and jointly on four common SLAM datasets, and are shown to improve the state-of-the-art performance both in terms of precision and recall in most of the cases. Moreover, our current implementation is designed to work at nearly frame rate, allowing loop closure query resolution at nearly 22 Hz for the best case scenario and 2 Hz for the worst case scenario.},

  abstract      = {Robust estimation of correspondences between image pixels is an important problem in robotics, with applications in tracking, mapping, and recognition of objects, environments, and other agents. Correspondence estimation has long been the domain of hand-engineered features, but more recently deep learning techniques have provided powerful tools for learning features from raw data. The drawback of the latter approach is that a vast amount of (labelled, typically) training data is required for learning. This paper advocates a new approach to learning visual descriptors for dense correspondence estimation in which we harness the power of a strong 3D generative model to automatically label correspondences in RGB-D video data. A fully-convolutional network is trained using a contrastive loss to produce viewpoint- and lighting-invariant descriptors. As a proof of concept, we collected two datasets: the first depicts the upper torso and head of the same person in widely varied settings, and the second depicts an office as seen on multiple days with objects re-arranged within. Our datasets focus on re-visitation of the same objects and environments, and we show that by training the CNN only from local tracking data, our learned visual descriptor generalizes towards identifying non-labelled correspondences across videos. We furthermore show that our approach to descriptor learning can be used to achieve state-of-the-art single-frame localization results on the MSR 7-scenes dataset without using any labels identifying correspondences between separate videos of the same scenes at training time.},

Our approach consists of three stages, the first is to adapt a pre-trained model to the task at hand. This provides state-of-the-art performance but at the cost of high computational complexity resulting in a low frame rate of just 0.12 frames per second (fps). Second, we use the adapted model and employ model compression techniques to learn a lightweight DCNN that is less accurate but has two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. Third, K lightweight models are combined as a mixture model to further enhance the performance of the lightweight models. Applied to the challenging task of weed segmentation, we improve accuracy from 85.9\%, using a traditional approach, to 93.9\% by adapting a complicated pre-trained DCNN with 25M parameters (Inception-v3). The downside to this adapted model, Adapted-IV3, is that it can only process 0.12fps. To make this approach fast while still retaining accuracy, we learn lightweight DCNNs which when combined can achieve accuracy greater than 90\% while using considerably fewer parameters capable of processing between 1.07 and 1.83 frames per second, up to an order of magnitude faster and up to an order of magnitude fewer parameters.},

We also perform an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers. This enables us to find model architectures that outperform Krizhevsky \etal on the ImageNet classification benchmark.

Deep learning-based object detector approaches have enabled great advances in using camera imagery to detect and classify objects. But for a safety critical application such as autonomous driving, the error rates of the current state-of-the-art are still too high to enable safe operation. Moreover, our characterization of object detector performance is primarily limited to testing on prerecorded datasets. Errors that occur on novel data go undetected without additional human labels. In this paper, we propose an automated method to identify mistakes made by object detectors without ground truth labels. We show that inconsistencies in object detector output between a pair of similar images can be used to identify false negatives(e.g. missed detections). In particular, we study two distinct cues - temporal and stereo inconsistencies - using data that is readily available on most autonomous vehicles. Our method can be used with any camera-based object detector and we evaluate the technique on several sets of real world data. The proposed method achieves over 97\% precision in automatically identifying missed detections produced by one of the leading state-of-the-art object detectors in the literature. We also release a new tracking dataset with over 100 sequences totaling more than 80,000 labeled images from a game engine to facilitate further research. },

  abstract      = {We present a novel approach for dense 3-D cloud reconstruction above an area of 10 × 10 km2 using two hemispheric sky imagers with fisheye lenses in a stereo setup. We examine an epipolar rectification model designed for fisheye cameras, which allows the use of efficient out-of-the-box dense matching algorithms designed for classical pinhole-type cameras to search for correspondence information at every pixel. The resulting dense point cloud allows to recover a detailed and more complete cloud morphology compared to previous approaches that employed sparse feature-based stereo or assumed geometric constraints on the cloud field. Our approach is very efficient and can be fully automated. From the obtained 3-D shapes, cloud dynamics, size, motion, type and spacing can be derived, and used for radiation closure under cloudy conditions, for example. Fisheye lenses follow a different projection function than classical pinhole-type cameras and provide a large field of view with a single image. However, the computation of dense 3-D information is more complicated and standard implementations for dense 3-D stereo reconstruction cannot be easily applied. Together with an appropriate camera calibration, which includes internal camera geometry, global position and orientation of the stereo camera pair, we use the correspondence information from the stereo matching for dense 3-D stereo reconstruction of clouds located around the cameras. We implement and evaluate the proposed approach using real world data and present two case studies. In the first case, we validate the quality and accuracy of the method by comparing the stereo reconstruction of a stratocumulus layer with reflectivity observations measured by a cloud radar and the cloud-base height estimated from a Lidar-ceilometer. The second case analyzes a rapid cumulus evolution in the presence of strong wind shear.},

  abstract      = {Dieses Kapitel gibt eine Einführung in die Kartenerstellung und gleichzeitige Lokalisierung mobiler Sensorplattformen. Die gemeinsame Lösung dieser beiden Probleme ist eine Voraussetzung für die Realisierung vieler technischer Systeme von leichten Fluggeräten über autonome Roboter bis hin zu mobilen Kameras. Als Simultaneous Localization and Mapping bezeichnet man die Aufgabe, die Trajektorie samt Orientierungsinformation einer sich bewegenden Plattform aus Beobachtungen zu schätzen und gleichzeitig eine Karte der Umgebung zu erstellen. Diese Aufgabe ist in vielen realen Systemen von entscheidender Bedeutung: einerseits stellen hochgenaue Karten mitunter einen Wert an sich für den Benutzer oder eine spezielle Anwendung dar, andererseits benötigen beispielsweise autonome Roboter ein solches Modell, um zielgerichtet selbstständig navigieren zu können. Das Simultaneous Localization and Mapping Problem, beziehungsweise Teilprobleme davon, werden, je nach verwendeter Sensorik, auch als Bündelausgleichung, Structure from Motion oder SLAM bezeichnet. In diesem Kapitel werden wir verschiedene Ansätze vorstellen, mit denen man das SLAM Problem adressieren kann. Dies beinhaltet neben dem klassischen Verfahren mittels Ausgleichung, welches offline auf allen Daten operiert, auch Filtertechniken wie den Kalman-Filter und den Partikel-Filter, die zu den Onlineverfahren zählen. Bei der Verwendung der Kleinsten-Quadrate Methode sowie beim Kalman-Filter wird meist eine Normalverteilung beziehungsweise eine unimodale Verteilung über die Positionen der 3D-Punkte in der Umgebung und die Orientierung des Sensors geschätzt. Im Gegensatz dazu arbeitet der Partikel-Filter nichtparametrisch und kann multiple Hypothesen über mögliche Datenassoziationen parallel schätzen. Neben den einzusetzenden Schätzverfahren wird auch skizziert, wie SLAM Systeme mit unterschiedlichen Sensoren realisiert werden können.},

In this paper, we present an algorithm that learns how to provide good route descriptions from a corpus of human-written directions. Using inverse reinforcement learning, our algorithm learns how to select the information for the description depending on the context of the route segment. The algorithm then uses the learned policy to generate directions that imitate the style of the descriptions provided by humans, thus taking into account personal as well as cultural preferences and special requirements of the particular user group providing the learning demonstrations. We evaluate our approach in a user study and show that the directions generated by our policy sound similar to human-given directions and substantially more natural than directions provided by commercial web services.},

Most of the systems developed thus far, however, are restricted to indoor scenarios, non-urban outdoor environments, or road usage with cars. Urban areas introduce numerous challenges to autonomous mobile robots as they are highly complex and in addition to that dynamic. In this paper, we present a navigation system for pedestrian-like autonomous navigation with mobile robots in city environments. We describe different components including a SLAM system for dealing with huge maps of city centers, a planning approach for inferring feasible paths taking also into account the traversability and type of terrain, and a method for accurate localization in dynamic environments. The navigation system has been implemented and tested in several large-scale field tests in which the robot Obelix managed to autonomously navigate from our university campus over a 3.3 km long route to the city center of Freiburg.},

SLAM addresses the problem of acquiring a spatial map of an environment while simultaneously localizing the robot relative to this model. The SLAM problem is generally regarded as one of the most important problems in the pursuit of building truly autonomous mobile robots. It is of great practical importance; if a robust, general-purpose solution to SLAM can be found, then many new applications of mobile robotics will become possible.},

  abstract      = {Modern service robots are designed to be deployed by end-users and not to be monitored by experts during operation. Most service robotics applications require reliable navigation capabilities of the robot. The calibration parameters of a mobile robot play a substantial role in navigation tasks. Often these parameters are subject to variations that depend either on environmental changes or on the wear of the devices. In this paper, we propose an approach to simultaneously estimate a map of the environment, the position of the on-board sensors of the robot, and its kinematic parameters. Our method requires no prior knowledge about the environment and relies only on a rough initial guess of the platform parameters. The proposed approach performs on-line estimation of the parameters and it is able to adapt to non-stationary changes of the configuration. Our approach has been implemented and is used on the EUROPA robot, a service robot operating in urban environments. In addition to that, we tested our approach in simulated environments and on a wide range of real world data using different types of robotic platforms.},

  abstract      = {Whereas probabilistic approaches are a powerful tool for mobile robot localization, they heavily rely on the proper definition of the so-called observation model which defines the likelihood of an observation given the position and orientation of the robot and the map of the environment. Most of the sensor models for range sensors proposed in the past either consider the individual beam measurements independently or apply uni-modal models to represent the likelihood function. In this paper we present an approach that learns place-dependent sensor models for entire range scans using Gaussian mixture models. To deal with the high dimensionality of the measurement space, we utilize principle component analysis for dimensionality reduction. In practical experiments carried out with data obtained from a real robot we demonstrate that our model substantially outperforms existing and popular sensor models.},

  abstract      = {For many applications, mobile robots need to estimate the geometry of their local surrounding area. To do so, proximity sensor such as laser range finders or sonars are typically employed. Cameras are a cheap and lightweight alternative to such sensors, but do not offer proximity information directly. In this paper, we present a novel approach to learning the relationship between range measurements and visual features extracted from a single monocular camera image. As the learning engine, we apply Gaussian processes, a non- parametric learning technique that not only yields the most likely range prediction corresponding to a certain visual input but also the predictive uncertainty. This information, in turn, can be utilized in an extended grid-based mapping scheme to update a model of the environment more gently where the predictions are unreliable. In practical experiments carried out with a mobile robot equipped with an omnidirectional camera system in different environments, we show that our system is able to predict range scans accurate enough to construct maps of the environment.},

These techniques include effective map-building capabilities, a method for obstacle avoidance based on a combination of range and visual information, and advanced Web and onboard robot interfaces. In addition to video streams, the system provides high-resolution virtual reality visualizations that also include the people in the vicinity of the robot. This increases the flexibility of the interface and simultaneously allows a user to understand the navigation actions of the robot. The techniques described in this article have been successfully deployed within the EU-funded projects TOURBOT and WebFAIR, which aimed to develop interactive tour-guided robots able to serve Web as well as on-site visitors. Technical developments in the framework of these projects have resulted in robust and reliable systems that have been demonstrated and validated in real-world conditions. Equally important, the system setup time has been drastically reduced, facilitating its porting to new environments.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modifica- tion to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the coefficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are ob- tained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

The UT is a method for predicting means and covariances in nonlinear systems. A set of samples are deterministically chosen which match the mean and covariance of a (not necessarily Gaussian-distributed) probability distribution. These samples can be scaled by an arbitrary constant. The method guarantees that the mean and covariance second order accuracy in mean and covariance, giving the same performance as a second order truncated filter but without the need to calculate any Jacobians or Hessians. The impacts of scaling issues are illustrated by considering conversions from polarto Cartesian coordinates with large angular uncertainties.},

Being a Nutshell guide, it is not a comprehensive manual, but it is complete enough to cover everything a working professional needs to know.

This book covers the C++ standard, the international standard published as ISO/IEC 14882:1998(E), Programming Languages—C++, plus Technical Corrigendum 1. Many implementations of C++ extend the language and standard library. Except for brief mentions of language and library extensions in the appendixes, this book covers only the standard. The standard library is large—it includes strings, containers, common algorithms, and much more—but it omits much that is commonplace in computing today: concurrency, network protocols, database access, graphics, windows, and so on. See Appendix B for information about nonstandard libraries that provide additional functionality. This book is a reference. It is not a tutorial. Newcomers to C++ might find portions of this book difficult to understand. Although each section contains some advice on idioms and the proper use of certain language constructs, the main focus is on the reference material.},

I prefer students to have either an image processing or a computer graphics course as a prerequisite so that they can spend less time learning general background mathematics and more time studying computer vision techniques. The book is also suitable for teaching graduate-level courses in computer vision (by delving into the more demanding application and algorithmic areas) and as a general reference to fundamental techniques and the recent research literature.

  abstract      = {Due to many exciting developments in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory, three topics that were once quite distinct are presently on a collision course. In robotics, motion planning was originally concerned with problems such as how to move a piano from one room to another in a house without hitting anything. The field has grown, however, to include complications such as uncertainties, multiple bodies, and dynamics. In artificial intelligence, planning originally meant a search for a sequence of logical operators or actions that transform an initial world state into a desired goal state. Presently, planning extends beyond this to include many decision-theoretic ideas such as Markov decision processes, imperfect state information, and game-theoretic equilibria. Although control theory has traditionally been concerned with issues such as stability, feedback, and optimality, there has been a growing interest in designing algorithms that find feasible open-loop trajectories for nonlinear systems. In some of this work, the term motion planning has been applied, with a different interpretation of its use in robotics. Thus, even though each originally considered different problems, the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory have expanded their scope to share an interesting common ground. In this text, I use the term planning in a broad sense that encompasses this common ground. This does not, however, imply that the term is meant to cover everything important in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence, and control theory. The presentation focuses on algorithm issues relating to planning. Within robotics, the focus is on designing algorithms that generate useful motions by processing complicated geometric models. Within artificial intelligence, the focus is on designing systems that use decision-theoretic models compute appropriate actions. Within control theory, the focus is on algorithms that compute feasible trajectories for systems, with some additional coverage of feedback and optimality. Analytical techniques, which account for the majority of control theory literature, are not the main focus here. The phrase planning and control is often used to identify complementary issues in developing a system. Planning is often considered as a higher-level process than control. In this text, I make no such distinctions. Ignoring historical connotations that come with the terms, planning or control can be used in terchangeably. Either refers to some kind of decision making in this text, with no associated notion of high or low level. A hierarchical approach can be developed, and either level could be called planning or control without any difference in meaning.},

This book goes further, bringing in Bayesian data modelling, Monte Carlo methods, variational methods, clustering algorithms, and neural networks. Why unify information theory and machine learning? Because they are two sides of the same coin. In the 1960s, a single field, cybernetics, was populated by information theorists, computer scientists, and neuroscientists, all studying common problems. Information theory and machine learning still belong together. Brains are the ultimate compression and communication systems.

We need learning in cases where we cannot directly write a computer program to solve a given problem, but need example data or experience. One case where learning is necessary is when human expertise does not exist, or when humans are unable to explain their expertise. Consider the recognition of spoken speech—that is, converting the acoustic speech signal to an ASCII text; we can do this task seemingly without any difficulty, but we are unable to explain how we do it. Different people utter the same word differently due to differences in age, gender, or accent. In machine learning, the approach is to collect a large collection of sample utterances from different people and learn to map these to words. The book discusses many learning methods that have their bases in different fields: statistics, pattern recognition, neural networks, artificial intelligence, signal processing, control, and data mining. In the past, research in these different communities followed different paths with different emphases. In this book, the aim is to incorporate them together to give a unified treatment of the problems and the proposed solutions to them. This is an introductory textbook, intended for senior undergraduate and graduate-level courses on machine learning, as well as engineers working in the industry who are interested in the application of these methods. The prerequisites are courses on computer programming, probability, calculus, and linear algebra. The aim is to have all learning algorithms sufficiently explained so it will be a small step from the equations given in the book to a computer program. For some cases, pseudocode of algorithms are also included to make this task easier.},

These applications span from simulating musical instruments in VR, to head tracking, to extracting lip motion from video sequences of speakers, to fitting spline surfaces over collections of points. The Kalman filter is the best possible (optimal) estimator for a large class of problems and a very effective and useful estimator for an even larger class.

It is motivated by the need for a conceptually consistent theory aiming at generic solutions for orientation and reconstruction problems.

The book aims at enabling researchers, software developers, and practitioners in the photogrammetric and GIS industry to design, write, and test their own algorithms and application software using statistically founded concepts to obtain optimal solutions and to realize self-diagnostics within algorithms. This is essential when applying vision tech- niques in practice. The material of the book can serve as a source for different levels of undergraduate and graduate courses in photogrammetry, computer vision, and computer graphics, and for research and development in statistically based geometric computer vision methods. The sixteen chapters of the book are self-contained, are illustrated with numerous fig- ures, have exercises, and are supported by an appendix and an index.

The current sensor pose is simultaneously obtained by tracking the live depth frame relative to the global model using a coarse-to-fine iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, which uses all of the observed depth data available. We demonstrate the advantages of tracking against the growing full surface model compared with frame-to-frame tracking, obtaining tracking and mapping results in constant time within room sized scenes with limited drift and high accuracy. We also show both qualitative and quantitative results relating to various aspects of our tracking and mapping system. Modelling of natural scenes, in real-time with only commodity sensor and GPU hardware, promises an exciting step forward in augmented reality (AR), in particular, it allows dense surfaces to be reconstructed in real-time, with a level of detail and robustness beyond any solution yet presented using passive computer vision.},

Herein, we present and review robotic applications on plant pathology and management, and emerging agricultural technologies for intra-urban agriculture. Greenhouse advanced management systems and technologies have been greatly developed in the last years, integrating IoT and WSN (Wireless Sensor Network). Machine learning, machine vision, and AI (Artificial Intelligence) have been utilized and applied in agriculture for automated and robotic farming. Intelligence technologies, using machine vision/learning, have been developed not only for planting, irrigation, weeding (to some extent), pruning, and harvesting, but also for plant disease detection and identification. However, plant disease detection still represents an intriguing challenge, for both abiotic and biotic stress. Many recognition methods and technologies for identifying plant disease symptoms have been successfully developed; still, the majority of them require a controlled environment for data acquisition to avoid false positives. Machine learning methods (e.g., deep and transfer learning) present promising results for improving image processing and plant symptom identification. Nevertheless, diagnostic specificity is a challenge for microorganism control and should drive the development of mechatronics and robotic solutions for disease management.},

    abstract   = {Many computer vision problems are formulated as the optimization of a cost function. This approach faces two main challenges: (1) designing a cost function with a local optimum at an acceptable solution, and (2) developing an efficient numerical method to search for one (or multiple) of these local optima. While designing such functions is feasible in the noiseless case, the stability and location of local optima are mostly unknown under noise, occlusion, or missing data. In practice, this can result in undesirable local optima or not having a local optimum in the expected place. On the other hand, numerical optimization algorithms in high-dimensional spaces are typically local and often rely on expensive first or second order information to guide the search. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Discriminative Optimization (DO), a method that learns search directions from data without the need of a cost function. Specifically, DO explicitly learns a sequence of updates in the search space that leads to stationary points that correspond to desired solutions. We provide a formal analysis of DO and illustrate its benefits in the problem of 2D and 3D point cloud registration both in synthetic and range-scan data. We show that DO outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin in terms of accuracy, robustness to perturbations, and computational efficiency.},

                  current camera pose. Furthermore, we decompose
                  landmark positions into a bearing vector and a
                  distance parametrization whereby we employ a minimal
                  representation of differences on a corresponding
                  σ-Algebra in order to achieve better consistency and
                  to improve the computational performance. Due to the
                  robocentric, inverse-distance landmark
                  parametrization, the framework does not require any
                  initialization procedure, leading to a truly
                  power-up-and-go state estimation system. The
                  presented approach is successfully evaluated in a
                  set of highly dynamic hand-held experiments as well
                  as directly employed in the control loop of a
                  multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).},

  abstract="This paper addresses the problem of 3D object reconstruction
                  using RGB-D sensors. Our main contribution is a
                  novel implicit-to-implicit surface registration
                  scheme between signed distance fields (SDFs),
                  utilized both for the real-time frame-to-frame
                  camera tracking and for the subsequent global
                  optimization. SDF-2-SDF registration circumvents
                  expensive correspondence search and allows for
                  incorporation of multiple geometric constraints
                  without any dependence on texture, yielding highly
                  accurate 3D models. An extensive quantitative
                  evaluation on real and synthetic data demonstrates
                  improved tracking and higher fidelity
                  reconstructions than a variety of state-of-the-art
                  methods. We make our data publicly available,
                  creating the first object reconstruction dataset to
                  include ground-truth CAD models and RGB-D sequences
                  from sensors of various quality.",

abstract={Where feature points are used in real-time frame-rate applications, a high-speed feature detector is necessary. Feature detectors such as SIFT (DoG), Harris and SUSAN are good methods which yield high quality features, however they are too computationally intensive for use in real-time applications of any complexity. Here we show that machine learning can be used to derive a feature detector which can fully process live PAL video using less than 7{\%} of the available processing time. By comparison neither the Harris detector (120{\%}) nor the detection stage of SIFT (300{\%}) can operate at full frame rate.}

title={Real-Time Model-Based SLAM Using Line Segments},
booktitle={Advances in Visual Computing},
year={2006},
pages={354-363},
abstract={Existing monocular vision-based SLAM systems favour interest point features as landmarks, but these are easily occluded and can only be reliably matched over a narrow range of viewpoints. Line segments offer an interesting alternative, as line matching is more stable with respect to viewpoint changes and lines are robust to partial occlusion. In this paper we present a model-based SLAM system that uses 3D line segments as landmarks. Unscented Kalman filters are used to initialise new line segments and generate a 3D wireframe model of the scene that can be tracked with a robust model-based tracking algorithm. Uncertainties in the camera position are fed into the initialisation of new model edges. Results show the system operating in real-time with resilience to partial occlusion. The maps of line segments generated during the SLAM process are physically meaningful and their structure is measured against the true 3D structure of the scene.},
